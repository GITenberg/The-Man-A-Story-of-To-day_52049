<p class="largefont center">LETTER NO. 1.</p>

<p class="marginrightindent"><span class="smcap">Buffalo</span>, N. Y., July 1, 1891.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Martha Heath</span>,</p>

<p><em>Friend</em>:&mdash;You said that someone would surely
print it, and I write you this to say that after four publishers
had most politely rejected the manuscript, the fifth has written
me saying the story does not amount to much; in fact,
that I have no literary style, but as the book is so out of the
general run they concluded to accept it. They sent me a
check for $300.00 which they say is a bonus, and after the
first 5,000 copies are sold they propose to pay me a royalty.
So you see even if I have lost my place at Hustler’s, I am
not destitute, so I will not accept your offer of a loan. You
and Grimes (dear old Grimes) are the only persons in all this
great city who have stood by me in my trouble. If you had
presented me with a box of candy I would thank you, but for
all the kindness I have received, prompted by your outspoken
and generous nature, I offer not a single word. Words, in
times like these, to such as you, are of small avail, my heart
speaks. You say you dislike awfully to see those last five
chapters in print, and so will I, my dear. Little did we think
when I began this book that the story would have such an
ending; but, Martha, I am not writing a pretty novel, but
simple truth just as the facts occurred. I offer no excuse nor
apology, but will simply give you this from Charles Kingsley’s
“Alton Locke:”</p>

<p>Scene: A street corner in London, on one hand a gin palace,
opposite a pawn shop&mdash;those two monsters who feed on
the vitals of the poor&mdash;all about is abject wretchedness.</p>

<p>Locke stops, sighs and says, “Oh, this is so very unpoetic.”
Sandy Mackaye replies, “What, man, no poetry here!
Why, what is poetry but chapters lifted from the drama of
life, and what is the drama if not the battle between man
and circumstance, and shall not man eventually conquer? I
will show you too in many a garret where no eye but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of the good God enters, the patience, the fortitude, the self-sacrifice
and the love stronger than death, all flourishing
while oppression and stupid ignorance are clawing at the
door!”</p>

<p>But right will conquer, dearest, and the goodness that has
never been weighed in the balances, nor tried in the fire, how
do you know it <em>is</em> goodness at all? It may only be namby-pamby&mdash;wishy-washy&mdash;goody-goody,
<em>who knows</em>? <em>We</em> are
all in God’s hand, sister, and the bad is the stuff sent, on
which to try our steel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Pygmalion Woodbur, Esq.</span>, Attorney-at-Law.</p>

<p><em>Sir</em>:&mdash;I have received your letter warning
me that if I use your name in a certain book of local history
(said book entitled <span class="smcap">The Man</span>) that you will cause my
arrest for malicious libel, and also sue me for damages. To
this I can only say that the book is now in the hands of
the electrotypers, and I am not inclined to change a line in
it, on your suggestion, even if I could. Please believe me,
when I say, that I bear you no ill-will and have no desire to
injure you or place you in a wrong light before the public,
what I have written being but truth penned without exaggeration
or coloring. I make no apology or excuse. What I
have written I have written.</p>

<p class="marginrightindent"><span class="smcap">Buffalo</span>, N. Y., July 3, 1891.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To John Bilkson</span>, of Hustler &amp; Co.,</p>

<p><em>Sir</em>:&mdash;Your registered letter of June 30th,
received, wherein you state that you have no further use for
my services, and that whereas you generally give an employee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a letter of recommendation when you discharge
them, yet in my case you cannot do so.</p>

<p>Although I have made no request for such recommendation,
I regret your conscience will not allow you to supply it.</p>

<p>You remember the scene of five years ago in your office?
No one knows a word of this, and never will, unless you tell
it (which I hardly think you care to do). You swore then you
would get even with me&mdash;is your vengeance now satisfied?</p>

<p>I have no malice toward you&mdash;I cannot afford to have
against anyone&mdash;although I must say that your action in
deducting from my wages the price of one set of false teeth
purchased from Dr. Poole is not exactly right. You know,
Mr. Bilkson, you lost those teeth purely through accident
and no one regretted the occurrence more than I. With best
wishes for the continued prosperity of Hustler &amp; Co., I
remain,</p>

<p>What I have to write is of such great value, the circumstances
so peculiar, the record so strange, and the
truths so startling, that it is but proper I should explain
who and what I am, in order that any person, so disposed,
may fully verify for himself the things I am
about to relate.</p>

<p>Just at that most quiet hour of all the twenty-four, in
the city, on a summer’s morning, when the darkness is
stubbornly giving way to daylight, there came a violent
ring at Mr. Hobbs’ door-bell, followed up with what
seemed to be quite an unnecessary knocking.</p>

<p>Mr. Hobbs was interested in an elevator, and when he
heard that ring he was sure the elevator had burned&mdash;in
fact, he had a presentiment that such would be the case;
besides this, Mr. Hobbs always carried a goodly assortment
of fears ready to use at any moment.</p>

<p>“There, didn’t I tell you!” he excitedly exclaimed to
his wife, as he rushed down the stairs&mdash;he hadn’t told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
his wife anything, just bottled up his fears in his own
bosom and let them ferment, but that made no difference&mdash;“Didn’t
I tell you!” and he hastily unlocked and
opened the door. No one there!</p>

<p>He looked up the street and down the street. Nothing
but a clothes-basket, covered over with a threadbare
shawl, which evidently a long time ago had been
a costly one. Mr. Hobbs expected a messenger with
bad news and Mr. Hobbs was disappointed, in fact was
mad; and he snatched that shawl from the basket,
staggered against the door, and a voice, like unto that
of a young and lusty bull, went up the stairway where
Mrs. Hobbs stood peering over the banisters:</p>

<p>“Maria, for God’s sake come quick! There’s something
awful happened! Quick, will you!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hobbs was not very brave, but curiosity often
reinforces courage; so the good lady came down the
stairs two steps at a time, and stood by the side of her liege,
who had got his breath by this time and stood peering
over the basket.</p>

<p>And there they stood together, all in white, with bare
feet, on the front porch, and nearly broad daylight.</p>

<p>In the basket, all wrapped up in dainty flannel, smiling,
cooing and kicking up its heels, lay a baby&mdash;well,
perhaps two months old, and on a card written with
pencil were these words:</p>

<p>“<em>God knows.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs had no children, and they each
looked upon this as a gift from providence&mdash;basket and
all. They cared for the waif as their own child, and if
their reward does not come in this life, I am sure it will
in another.</p>

<p>“Her name shall be Aspasia Hobbs, for I always said
my first girl (Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs had been married five
years, and had no children, but the babies were already
named; which, I am told, is the usual custom) should
be named Aspasia, after your mother, dear,” said Mrs.
Hobbs.</p>

<p>And Aspasia Hobbs it was, and is yet: and I am
Aspasia Hobbs: and Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs are the only
parents I have ever known.</p>

<p>I am now an old maid, aged thirty-seven (I must tell
the truth). I am homely and angular, and can pass along
the street without a man turning to look at me. From
five years’ constant pounding on a caligraph my hands
have grown large and my knuckles and the ends of my
fingers are like knobs. I can walk twenty miles a day,
or ride a wheel fifty.</p>

<p>The bishop of Western New York, in a sermon
preached recently, said riding bicycles is “unladylike”
(and so is good health for that matter)&mdash;but if the good
bishop would lay aside prejudice and robe and mount
a safety, he could still show men the right way as well as
now&mdash;possibly better, who knows?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>But, in the language of Spartacus, “I was not always
thus.” Thank Heaven, I am strong and well! They
used to say, “She is such a delicate, sensitive child, we
can not keep her without we take very, v-e-r-y good care
of her.” Some fool has said that hundreds of people die
every year because they have such “very good care.”</p>

<p>My father was a member of the firm of Hobbs, Nobbs
&amp; Porcine, was a Board of Trade man, and, therefore,
had no time to give to his children; but he was a good
provider, as the old ladies say, and used to remind us
of it quite often. “Don’t I get you everything you
need?” he once roared at my mother, when she hinted
that an evening home once in a while would not be out
of place. “Here you have an up-stairs girl, a cook, a
laundress, a coachman, a gardener, a tutor for Aspasia,
and don’t I pay Doctor Bolus just five hundred dollars a
year to call here every week and examine you all so as
to keep you healthy? Great Scott, the ingratitude of
woman! they are getting worse and worse every day!”</p>

<p>My father was a good man&mdash;that is he was not bad,
so he must have been good. He never used tobacco,
and I never heard him swear but once, and that was
when Professor Connors brought in a bill reading:</p>

<p>“Debtor, to calisthenics for wife and daughter, $50.”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay it,” said my father grimly, “but I will deduct
it from Bolus’ check, for you say it’s for the health and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
therefore it belongs to Bolus’ department and he should
have furnished the goods.”</p>

<p>We lived on Delaware avenue, in one of the finest
houses, which my father bought and had furnished
throughout before my mother or any one of us were
allowed to enter. He was a good man, and wanted to
astonish&mdash;that is to say, surprise us. So one Saturday
night, at dinner, he said,</p>

<p>“On Monday, my dears, we will leave this old Michigan
street for a house on the ‘Avenue.’ I have
given up our pew in Grace Church, and to-morrow, and
hereafter, Rev. Fred. C. Inglehart and Delaware avenue
are plenty good enough for us.”</p>

<p>Our family have the finest monument in Forest Lawn,
and father assured us that if Methusalah was now a boy
this monument would be new when his great grandchildren
died of old age. He waxed enthusiastic, and
added, as he lapsed into reverie,</p>

<p>“It’s a regular James Dandy, and knocks out Rodgers
and Jowette in one round.”</p>

<p>I am a graduate of Dr. Chesterfield’s academy, and
also of the high-school. I have studied music with Mr.
McNerney and Senor Nuno, elocution with Steele Mackaye;
and father once offered to wager Mr. Porcine that
“Aspasia could do up any girl on the avenue or Franklin
street at the piano.”</p>

<p>I was a rich (alleged) man’s daughter, and as I had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
managing mamma and went in society I had the usual
love (how that word is abused!) experiences. I am not
writing an autobiography, but merely telling what is
absolutely necessary for you to know of me; otherwise,
I would relate some insipid mush about flirtations with
several gilded youths, who waltzed delightfully and
made love abominably&mdash;just as if a man could <em>make</em>
love! But suffice it to say, I never, in those old days,
met a man I could not part with and feel relieved when
he had taken his “darby” and slender cane and hied
him down the steps. Mamma said I was heartless and
didn’t know a good chance when I saw it.</p>

<p>One little affair of the pocket-book&mdash;that is, I mean
of the heart&mdash;might be mentioned. A certain attorney,
Pygmalion Woodbur by name&mdash;old Buffalonians know
him well&mdash;paid his respects to me in an uneasy and
stilted fashion. He was ten years my senior, had a
monster yellow moustache generally colored black, which
he combed down over the cavern in his face. He dressed
in the latest, and was looked upon as a great catch.
How these old bachelor men-about-town are lionized by a
certain set of women!</p>

<p>He called several times, invited himself to dinner,
took mamma riding and threw out side glances&mdash;grimaces&mdash;in
my direction. One fine evening I sat reading
in the parlor, alone, and in walked Mr. Woodbur and
began about thusly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aspasia&mdash;I may call you by your first name, now
can’t I?&mdash;and you must call me Pyggie, for short. I
have just spoken to your father and he says it’s all
right,” etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p>

<p>He slid off from the sofa on his knees, and seized my
left hand and kissed it violently.</p>

<p>Fair lady, have you ever been kissed with a rush, by
a man with a large yellow moustache colored black?
Well it’s just like being jabbed with a paint brush!</p>

<p>Now, after his poorly memorized speech had been delivered,
and I had jerked my hand away, there was a
pause. I tried to laugh and I tried to cry; then I tried
to faint, and was too mad to do either; so I just inwardly
raged and then came the explosion&mdash;</p>

<p>“No! no! no! a thousand times <em>no</em>! Stick to you,
Woodbur! <em>Never!</em> I hate you&mdash;get out of my sight,
quick!”</p>

<p>Just then in came papa and mamma, who it seems
were taking a turn about at the keyhole.</p>

<p>“Why! why what’s the matter with my little girl,”
and I fell sobbing in my mother’s arms.</p>

<p>“You must excuse her, Mr. Woodbur,” said the good
lady. “Since her sunstroke, she has these spells quite
often. You will excuse her, I know.”</p>

<p>“Why, when was the gal struck! You never told
me nothing about it,” broke in my father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now Hobbs, don’t be a fool,” said my mother under
her breath.</p>

<p>Father started to answer. Woodbur saw his opportunity,
and escaped under cover of the smoke, and forgot
to come back for his umbrella, which I now have
tied up with a white ribbon and put away with mint
and lavender in memory of days gone by&mdash;and the best
that I can say of the days that have gone by is that
they have gone by.</p>

<p>As time wore, life seemed to grow dull and heavy, my
cheeks grew pale, and in summer I sat on the piazza,
often from breakfast until dinner-time, with a white crepe
shawl thrown about my shoulders, listlessly watching
the passers-by. Mother said, “Poor girl, I wish she
would get mad just once as she used to. She is so good
and submissive.” Doctor Bolus said I needed cod liver
oil with strong doses of quinine, and once a week Glauber
salts taken in molasses and sulphur; but still in spite
of all medicine could do for me, I grew weaker and
weaker. I fed on Mrs. Hemans and Tupper, and finally
they carried me daily out to the big carriage, and the
coachman was instructed to drive very slowly, and we
went out through the Park, out to Forest Lawn and
looked at our family monument, which gleamed in the
beautiful sunshine.</p>

<p>Mother generally rode with me, and one morning she
left me waiting in the carriage while she went over near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
our “lot,” so she could more closely inspect the monument.
While waiting the coachman turned to me and
said:</p>

<p>“Missis, yer father have bust, yer mother don’t know
it; but you are no fool, missis, and I thought you should
know it, to kinder prepare like. They have been around
inventizering the horses and carriages and are going to
sell them next week&mdash;see? And my wife said you are
the only one who has sense, and I should break the news
to you easy like&mdash;see?”</p>

<p>I heard him rattling on, but did not seem to understand
what he said; but I felt my heart beating fast
and the blood coming to my cheeks. The old dead submissiveness
was gone, and I said:</p>

<p>“John, shut up, and repeat to me what you said
first.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” said John, “only that your father have
bust and run off to Canada, and C. J. Hummer and the
rest is goin’ to bounce you out next week.”</p>

<p>I saw his grieved tone, or felt it rather, and said:</p>

<p>“John, I did not mean to speak cross to you.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, missis, I have no favors to ax, and you
couldn’t grant eny even if I did&mdash;for your father have
bust, dwye see?”</p>

<p>Mother was coming from the monument, and greatly
vexed, I saw.</p>

<p>“Why, Smythe has not put any foundation under it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
at all scarcely,” she said, as she stepped into the carriage.
“The weight on top is gradually crushing the
bottom, and I believe it is full six inches toppled over
to the west.”</p>

<p>“It is probably going west to grow up with the country,”
I said.</p>

<p>Think of such a remark from a dying invalid!</p>

<p>My mother turned in astonishment to see if it was
really her daughter.</p>

<p>“John,” said I, “drive home&mdash;go fast&mdash;let them out,
will you&mdash;go home quick. Mrs. Hobbs is not well.”</p>

<p>I felt an awful propensity to joke, and a wild exultation
and pleasure came over me that I had not known
since we used to climb the hills at our summer-house at
Strykersville. John cracked the whip and saluted all
the other coachmen as we passed. He whistled, and so
did I. For the first time in five years I felt free; and
John had lost the fear that he would not be impressive,
and he too was free. My mother sat bolt upright in a
rage.</p>

<p>“You are both drunk,” she said. “John, sit straight
on that box. Don’t carry the whip over your shoulder,
and don’t cross your legs or I will discharge you Saturday
night!”</p>

<p>John turned round&mdash;smiled&mdash;looked at me and winked.</p>

<p>As the carriage stopped in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portière</i> the big gardener
came down, and placing one arm under and the
other about me, was just going to lift the invalid out as
usual.</p>

<p>“Go away,” I fairly screamed. “Let me walk, will
you! Carry mother in quick,” for sure enough, she was
the one who had to be carried. Her rigid dignity had
disappeared, and she had dropped back listless and
disheveled, moaning:</p>

<p>“Oh, John is drunk and Aspasia crazy! Look at her!
she is so sick she can’t walk, and yet see her run up
those steps! What shall I do, what shall I do! And
the monument that they warranted in writing to last
for ever or no pay is tumbling down. I must have it
fixed, even if it costs ten thousand dollars; for the name
of Hobbs must not grow dim.” “Dear he” (she always
spoke of her husband as simply “he” or “him”) “has so
often said, ‘You married Hobbs for better or worse’&mdash;says
he to me&mdash;‘and your name will be carved on the
finest monument in Forest Lawn.’“</p>

<p>Reader bold&mdash;lacking in knowledge and therefore in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
faith, limiting possibility to your own tiny experience,
quick to deny&mdash;you doubt that I went away an invalid
and returned in an hour cured. Let me whisper in your
ear that it was all in accordance with natural law, and
not at all strange or miraculous, excepting in the sense
that all nature is miraculous (let us not quarrel over definitions).
That which cured me was a good dose of
Animating Purpose.</p>

<p>Men retire from business and die in a year from lack
of animating purpose. Women are protected, hedged
about and propped up, cared for, and die for the lack of
this essential.</p>

<p>“Faith Cure,” “Christian Science” and any other
strong desire filled with hope and a determination to <em>be</em>
and to <em>do</em>, supply animating purpose of a good kind,
although sometimes, possibly, alloyed with error: but
any good idea which makes us forget self and sends the
blood coursing through our veins, is healing in its nature.</p>

<p>When the stays that held me were cut, and I knew I
must live and work and be useful, the old sickly self was
thrust far behind by Animating Purpose; not the finest
quality of animating purpose, I will admit, but a fairly
good serviceable article, and certainly a thousand times
better than none.</p>

<p>You must not think that my mother was naturally
weak&mdash;not so. Of a fine delicate organization, she married
when nineteen and had given herself unreservedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to her husband in mind and body (for have not husbands
“rights?”) never doubting but what it was her
wifely duty to do so. She even gave up her own church
and joined his&mdash;adopted his opinions&mdash;quoted his sayings
and repeated his jokes. “Well, <em>he</em> says so and that
is an end to it.” In the house of Hobbs, Hobbs was the
court of last appeal.</p>

<p>In some marriages women say “I will” audibly, with
mental reservation of “when circumstances permit.”
Such women have been instructed in diplomacy. They
have been told to meet their husbands at the door with
a smile and clean collar, to make home pleasant, to
smooth down the rough places&mdash;in short, to manage
the man and never let him discover it, which is the finest
of the finest arts. They can examine his pockets at such
convenient times when he will not know it, count his
money, take what they need&mdash;which is better than
harassing a man and whining for a dollar&mdash;read his note-book,
and thus in a thousand little ways keep such close
track of him that with proper skill there would be positively
no excuse for rubbing him the wrong way of the
fur.</p>

<p>But not so with my mother. She said to Mr. Hobbs
on their wedding night,</p>

<p>“I am yours&mdash;wholly yours. In your presence I will
think aloud, there shall be no concealment. To you I
give my soul and body!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hobbs took the latter, and in a hoarse whisper
said:</p>

<p>“I have an income of six thousand dollars a year, and
you shall never regret you married Hobbs, of Hobbs,
Nobbs &amp; Porcine. I will shield you from every unpleasant
thing; you shall never know care or trouble;
never a day’s work shall you do; nothing but just be
happy and look pretty the livelong day; and anything
you want at Barnes &amp; Bancroft’s, Peter Paul’s, Dickinson’s
or Fulton Market, why get it and have it charged
to Hobbs, for I am rated in ‘Dun’ ‘E. 2,’ and next year
it will be ‘2 plus.’”</p>

<p>Such total unselfishness touched the virgin heart of
this nineteen-year’s-old woman&mdash;that is to say, child.
She lived in a Hobbs’ atmosphere. The two lives did
not grow into one, she became Mrs. Hobbs not only in
name but in fact. Now any thinking person will admit
that this was better than for her to have endeavored to
retain her individuality, for if she had done this and
still was honest and frank, there would have been strife.
She would always have thought of her girlhood as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante bellum</i> times, for Mr. Hobbs had ideas, or believed
he had, and nothing gave him such delicious joy as to
rub these ideas into one, especially if they squirmed and
protested.</p>

<p>I have seen precocious children that astonished or
made jealous as the case might be. How they did sing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
play the banjo, or speak! One such boy I remember&mdash;we
were all sure he would grow to be an orator who
would shake the nation. I watched him, and saw him to-day
presiding at the second chair in Chadduck’s tonsorial
palace, and noted the Ciceronian wave of his hand
as he shouted the legend, “Next gentleman&mdash;shave.”</p>

<p>Walking across a prairie in Iowa with a friend, we
suddenly found ourselves going through a miniature
grove, where the highest trees did not reach my shoulders.
I examined the leaves and found the trees to be
black-oak of the most perfect type.</p>

<p>“What beautiful young trees! How they will grow
and grow and put out their roots in every direction, and
search the very bowels of the earth for the food and sustenance
they need! How they will toss their branches
in defiance to the storm, and be a refuge and defence for
the wearied traveler! How&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop that gush, will you please!” said my companion.
“These are only scrub-oaks and will not be any
larger if they live a hundred years.”</p>

<p>Possibly this grove explains why the average man of
sixty is no wiser and no better than the average man of
forty&mdash;it is Arrested Development.</p>

<p>My good mother is only a fine type of Arrested Development.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III_A_LITTLE_LOCAL_HISTORY" id="CHAPTER_III_A_LITTLE_LOCAL_HISTORY">CHAPTER III.<br /><span class="largefont">A LITTLE LOCAL HISTORY.</span></a></h2>


<p>With my woman’s intuition I knew all just from
the hint John gave. My father a week before had gone
to Montreal, saying he would be back Wednesday. It was
now Friday and he had not returned. I remember the
two men who had come to “take an inventory for the
‘Tax Office,’” one said, and he winked at the other.
How they walked through the house with their hats on
and joked each other as they tried the piano! I saw it
all! My father had lost money and had given a chattel
mortgage on the furniture, having first raised all the
money he could on the real estate.</p>

<p>I asked my mother if she remembered giving the
mortgage, and she looked at me, grieved and surprised,
saying:</p>

<p>“Why, of course not, dear. I always signed the papers
he brought me. Do you think it a woman’s place to ask
questions about business?”</p>

<p>Well, if I were writing my own history, I would
tell you how the two men from the “Tax Office” came
back with Robert McCann the auctioneer; how they
hung a big red flag over the sidewalk and took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the carpets so that when they walked across the bare
floor of the big parlors the echo of the footsteps rang
through the whole house; how greasy men with hook
noses came and examined the furniture; of how one
such insisted on seeing my mother on very private
business, when he asked, “If dot bainting was a real
Millais or only a schnide; and if it was a schnide, to
gif a zerdificate dat it vas a Millais and I will bid
it off at a hundred, so hellup me gracious!”; of how
kind neighbors came and bought in all the dishes and
silverware and gave them back to us; of how a certain
widowed gentleman offered to bid in the piano if I would
accept a position as governess for his daughter and live
at his house.</p>

<p>Well, the furniture went and so did we. The Fitch
ambulance came and took mother down to our new
quarters, which I had rented on South Division street,
near Cedar, and right pretty did the little house look too.
Mrs. Grimes, the laundress, came with us&mdash;in fact, came
in spite of us.</p>

<p>“I have no money to pay you, and you cannot come.
That is all there is about it,” I protested.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want no money,” said this gray-haired
old woman. “I have ’leven hundred dollars in the Erie
County, and it is all yours if you want it. Haven’t I
worked for the Hobbses three weeks lacking two days
before you was left on the steps? I was the only girl they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
had then, and I am the only girl you got now. I have
sent my hair trunk down to South Division street, and
I’m going myself on the next load with Bill Smith, who
drives the van for Charlie Miller. I knowed Bill before
I did you, and Bill says he will stand by Aspasia Hobbs
too, he does.”</p>

<p>What could I do but kiss the grizzled kindly face of
this old “girl” on both cheeks and let her come?</p>

<p>It was a full month before we got track of my father.
I went to Montreal and brought back an old man, with
tottering mind, crushed in spirit. He had fixed his
heart on things of earth&mdash;he became a part of them,
they of him&mdash;and when they went down there was only
one result. He lingered along for three months, constantly
reproaching himself; seeing also reproach in the
face of every passer-by, imagining upbraidings in each
look of those who sought to comfort and care for him,
and the light of his life went out in darkness.</p>

<p>My mother received a little money from the life
insurance companies. Father patronized only assessment
companies, as they are cheap. He prided himself
on his financial ability, always saying he could
invest money as well as any rascally insurance president
and that there was “nothing like having your money
where you can put your claw on it in case you get a
straight tip.”</p>

<p>Idle I could not be, and I resolved to get a situation.</p>

<p>“Verily, I will teach school, for the young must be
educated,” I said, “or the world cannot be tamed. I
must, I will mould growing character.” In fact, I felt a
call; so I called on Mr. Straight, the superintendent of education,
never doubting but that he would at once give me
an opportunity to show my ability. I displayed my Dr.
Chesterfield and the high-school diplomas, and various
certificates from long-haired and eccentric foreigners,
(not forgetting Prof. Franklin of Col. Webber’s and
Judge Lewis’s testimonials, who imparts dramatic instruction
for one dollar an impart) as to my ability in
music, dancing, French, German, and deportment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The superintendent counted the certificates and diplomas
as he piled them up on his desk, and asked me if I
had any “pull.” Then he asked me why I did not get
married, and said he had been looking for me, “for
whenever a man busts his daughters always come here
for a job.” He took my name in a big book, and as he
waved me out remarked that “there are only seven
hundred applicants ahead of you. I’m afraid you are
not in it. You had better catch on to some young
fellow, my dear, before the crow’s feet get too pronounced&mdash;&mdash;ta,
ta.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I stood outside the door confused, defeated, angry. I
thought of a thousand things I should have said to that
grinning insinuating superintendent, and here I had not
said a word. I was out in the hall, the door was shut.
Slowly my wrath took form in action, and I walked off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with a much more emphatic tread than was becoming in
a young woman. I slammed my parasol against the
banisters at every stride as I went down the city hall
steps. I had a plan. Straight to the <cite>News</cite> office I
went, intending to insert an advertisement and thus secure
exactly the position I desired. I bought a paper to see
how other people advertised, and my eyes fell on the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wanted</span>: As correspondent, book-keeper and stenographer,
a young woman who can translate German, French, and
Italian, who is not afraid to work, and can look after the
business in proprietor’s absence. Wages, $4.75 per week.</p>

<p style="text-align:right;margin-right:5em">Apply to <span class="smcap">Hustler &amp; Co.</span>,</p>

<p style="text-align:right;margin-right:3em">Manufacturers of Glue,</p>

<p style="text-align:right;margin-right:1em">Genesee Street.</p></blockquote>

<p>I took the paper and entered a herdic, telling the
driver to hurry as I wanted to go to Hustler &amp; Co.’s.</p>

<p>Arriving there, I walked in, banged the door, and
demanded to see Hustler, omitting all title and prefix.
Straight had brow-beaten and insulted me an hour before&mdash;let
Hustler try if he dare. I wanted a position, not
advice, and would brook no parley or nonsense.</p>

<p>“Are you Hustler?” I asked of a little meek bald-headed
man, with a ginger-colored fringe of hair like a
lambrequin around his occiput. He plead guilty. “And
did you,” I continued hurriedly, but in a determined
manner, “and did you insert this advertisement?” and I
spread out the paper before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>“Did you, or did you not?”</p>

<p>Here I moved back three paces and gazed at him as
though I had him on cross-examination. He admitted
that he had inserted the advertisement, had not yet
found a young woman who could fill all of the conditions,
and that I could have the place.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, when the whistle blows for seven
o’clock,” said he.</p>

<p>At last I was no longer a dependent! From this time
on I would not only earn my own living, but I would do
for others. I was no longer a pensioner.</p>

<p>“He who receives a pension gives for it his manhood,”
said Plato. A pension makes a man a mendicant.
When the world is peopled by God’s people, every man
will work according to his ability, and will be paid for
his services, so there will neither be pensioners nor
bumptious bestowers.</p>

<p>My work at Hustler &amp; Co.’s was not difficult, when I
got over the scare and the belief that it was awfully
complex. In short, the lion was chained, as it always is
when we get up close and inspect the animal; or perhaps,
it is only a stuffed lion that has been terrifying us.
Possibly some evilly disposed person, seeing our fear, has
taken pains to wipe the dust off the fiery glass eyes, to
rough up the tawny mane, and set the tail at that terrific
angle&mdash;but who is afraid of a lion on wheels? When I
became composed and took a common sense view of the
work, the difficulties took wing, and at the end of the
first week, Mr. Hustler gave me the assurance “that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was no slouch,” which is the highest compliment that
Rustler Hustler, of the firm of Hustler &amp; Co., glue makers,
was ever known to pay to any living soul.</p>

<p>One of the girls in the office told me that the former
stenographer lost her place by taking dictation for Mr.
Bilkson, the junior partner, at close range; which
being interpreted, meant that when Mr. Bilkson dictated
his letters to the young lady, he had her sit on his knee.
Mrs. Bilkson is a large, determined woman with a jealous
nature and red parasol. As she appeared in the private
office one day without first sending in her card, the
close range plan was discovered. Soon after that little
Miss Bustle was found to be incompetent, and the cashier
gave her her time. Bilkson still remains.</p>

<p>When the junior dictates letters to me, it is through
the little sliding window that connects my room with
the general office. This was at my suggestion after a
few days’ acquaintanceship with the gentleman. I fear
I also incurred his enmity when I told him I was hired
to do the work, not to entertain the firm.</p>

<p>Saturdays we have half a day off&mdash;that is, we work
until 1:30 and are docked half a day.</p>

<p>Every one who knows me, knows I am a great bicycler&mdash;in
fact, working closely, if it were not for the outdoor
exercise I get, I could never stand the strain, but
would be a candidate for nervous prostration (technical
name Americanitis). Some years ago I had an awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
bad spell. Dr. Bolus was sent for and prescribed quinine
and iron with a trip to Bermuda and rest for a year.
My old friend, Martha Heath, came in soon after, and I
asked her to go to Stoddard’s drugstore for the quinine.</p>

<p>“I won’t,” said Martha Heath. “Bounce Bolus and
buy a bicycle!”</p>

<p>I followed her advice, and have blessed Martha Heath
ever since.</p>

<p>It was my custom on Saturdays after I had eaten my
lunch at the factory, to take my wheel and go on a long
ride, sometimes in the summer as far as Niagara Falls,
getting back late in the evening. These long quiet rides
I anticipated with much pleasure, for to get away from
the strife of men out into the quiet country, seemed to
give me new life. The winter gave me little opportunity
for these trips, so I looked forward longingly to the
coming of spring.</p>

<p>The month of April, 1891, it will be remembered
was remarkable, in that there was not a single fall of
rain from the 10th to the 30th. The roads were dry and
dusty as in summer. Saturday afternoon, April 30th,
when I rode out Clinton street in the delightful sunshine
which seemed to bear healing on its wings, women
were working in the gardens, cleaning up the rubbish;
children playing on the road; a faint smell of bonfire
from burning rubbish, people starting in in the spring
to keep the yards clean; men plowing in the fields; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
how the frogs did croak! Joy and gladness on every
hand. Out through Gardenville, past Ebenezer, five
o’clock found me at Hurdville. I was so very busy
drinking in the glorious scene that I had ridden slower
than I intended, for I had made calculations to be at
Aurora before this time, and well on the way homeward.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “Aspasia Hobbs, you had better hurry
up or night will catch you. Besides, the wind has come
up strong from the southwest, and away off over the
Colden hills is a little black cloud&mdash;what a joke if you
should get wet?”</p>

<p>There is a lane running across from Hurdville to the
Buffalo plank road, so I decided to cut my trip short and
strike across at once. I looked at my watch and it was
just 5:15 when I entered the lane, which was grass-grown
and not at all adapted for bicycling. As I pushed on,
the road grew worse, so I got off and pushed the wheel
ahead of me. Rather hard work it proved, as I wore a long
woolen dress, which I had to hold up in walking.</p>

<p>Then I tried riding again. A great yellow ominous
brightness was in the west, and soon I noticed it was
growing dark, and that the little cloud had grown until
it seemed to cover the whole western sky. A few big
rain drops fell as I looked again at my watch, which
said six o’clock. I kept thinking I must come to the
plank road every minute, and strained my eyes for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
telegraph poles which I knew marked the highway.
But no, I could not see them. “Surely this lane must
cross the main road or I am turned around and am following
a road running parallel with the other,” I concluded.</p>

<p>Still I trudged on, now riding, then walking. It began
to rain now in right good earnest. I felt the mud
sticking to my shoes and my clothes growing heavy.
My arms grew tired pushing the wheel before me as I
walked. The spokes had become a solid mass of mud.
I tried to mount the wheel. It swerved and I lay in the
ditch. I then realized that to try to push the bicycle
further or to ride would be folly; so I pulled the machine
into the bushes, and looked around me on every
side. Not even a lightning glare to relieve the gloom
and brighten the landscape. The rain still fell in torrents.
I covered my face with my hands. I thought
of my mother waiting in the bright light of our little
dining-room, the supper on the table. I tried to imagine
this howling wind and blackness of the night was a
dream; but no, I was alone&mdash;<em>alone</em>, <em>lost</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI_THE_LOG_CABIN" id="CHAPTER_VI_THE_LOG_CABIN">CHAPTER VI.<br /><span class="largefont">THE LOG CABIN.</span></a></h2>


<p>It was the worst night I ever saw, and I hope I may
never see another one like it. How the winds did roar
through the branches and the wild crash now and then
of a falling tree was most appalling. The darkness was
intense. The cold rain came in beating gusts, and I felt
it was gradually turning to sleet and snow.</p>

<p>Think of it, I, a city-bred woman, alone on an out-of-the-way
country road, dense woods on either side, mud
and slush ankle deep, wandering I knew not where!</p>

<p>My clothes weighed a hundred pounds. They clung
to my tired form and I seemed ready to fall with fatigue,
when I saw, not far ahead of me, the glimmer of a
light which seemed to come from a small log house a
quarter of a mile back from the road.</p>

<p>Straight toward the welcoming glimmering light,
through bramble, bush and stumps, I stumbled my way,
now and then sinking near knee deep in some hole where
a tree had been uprooted. I think I rather pounded on
the door than rapped, and so fearful was I that I would
not meet with a welcome reception, that I began scarcely
before the door was opened explaining in a loud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
excited voice (for I am but a woman after all), begging
that I might be warmed and sheltered only until daylight,
when I could make my way back, promising pay
in a sight draft on Hustler &amp; Co., for in my coming away
I had left my purse in my office dress. I only remember
that what I took for an old man opened the door,
led me in, showing not the slightest look of curiosity or
surprise, but seeming rather to be expecting me. He
stopped my excited talking by saying, in the mildest,
sweetest baritone I ever heard,</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. It is turning to snow. You lost your
way and are wet and cold. Look at this cheerful fireplace
and this pile of pine wood. My wife is here; but
no, I have no woman’s clothes either. You had better
take off your dress and let it dry over the chair. Then
if you stand before the fire your other raiment will soon
dry on you, which is as good as changing; and in the
meantime, I will get you something to eat.”</p>

<p>That night seems now as if it belonged to a former
existence, so soft and hazy when viewed across memory’s
landscape. I only know that as soon as the man stopped
my hurried explanations, the sense of fear vanished,
and I felt as secure as when a child I prattled about my
mother’s rocking-chair as she watched me with loving
eyes. I said not a word, so great was the peace that
had come over me. After a plain supper, of which I
partook heartily, I remember climbing a ladder up into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the garret of this log house, and stooping so as not to
strike my head against the rafters; also The Man’s tucking
me in bed as though I were a child, putting an
extra blanket over me while saying softly to himself as
if he were speaking to a third person,</p>

<p>“She must be kept warm. Nature’s balm will heal,
sleep is the great restorer, to-morrow she will feel all
the better for this little experience. So is the seeming
bad turned into good.”</p>

<p>He passed his hand gently over my eyes, took up the
candle and I heard him move down the ladder and&mdash;sweet
childlike sleep held me fast.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII_THE_MAN" id="CHAPTER_VII_THE_MAN">CHAPTER VII.<br /><span class="largefont">THE MAN.</span></a></h2>


<p>The morning sun came creeping through the cracks of
the garret as I slowly awoke to consciousness and began
rubbing my eyes, trying to make out where I was and
how I came there. Slowly it dawned upon me, the awful
work of trying to push that wheel through the mud;
the descending darkness; the increasing storm; of how
I left the bicycle by the road-side and the sickening
sense that came over me as I felt that I had lost my way
and must find shelter or perish; of how my heavy
woolen dress, soaked with water, tangled my tired legs as
I struggled forward; of the glimmering light, and how I
feared that though I had at last found a house they
might mistake me for an outcast and have no pity on
me; of the sweet peace I experienced when the old man
spoke to me; of following his suggestion that I should
remove my dress; of how I stood clad only in my under-clothing
before the fire, and of how he put me to
bed, and I was all unabashed and unashamed. I thought
of all this and more, and was just getting ready to be
thoroughly frightened when my reverie was broken into
by hearing a step come lightly up the ladder, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
beautiful face of The Man framed in its becoming snowy
white hair appeared.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is awake,” he said, again seemingly talking
to a third person. “She will be a little sore of course
after the exertion, but refreshed and all the stronger for
the hard work. Paradoxical&mdash;effort put forth causes
power to accumulate in the body, which is only a storage
battery after all. By giving out power we gain it,
by losing life we save it. How simple yet how wonderful
are the works of God!” Then speaking to me: “I
will bring you warm water for a bath. It will take the
stiffness out of your limbs. Breakfast will be ready
when you are.”</p>

<p>I bathed, dressed without the aid of a glass, and was
surprised to feel how strong and well I felt. Down I
went cautiously on the ladder, and we ate breakfast,
neither speaking a word. It seemed as if (glib as I generally
am&mdash;“A regular gusher,” Martha Heath says) to
break in on the silence would be sacrilege. Silence is
music at rest.</p>

<p>Out of every fifty men who pass along the street, only
one thinks; the forty-nine have feelings but no thoughts.
We have no time here to treat of the forty-nine; let us
leave them out of the question and deal only with the
one, the men of character, so-called, men who have opinions
and hold them. In this class we cannot admit the
girl-men or boy-men or those who are called men simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
because they are not women, or the vicious or even those
of doubtful morality. Let us take only the best and not
even consider the “unco-gude.” Now having banished
the unthinking, the immoral and the doubtful, tell me,
reader, have you ever seen a man? Have you? Not a
caricature or imitation of one, full of a wish to be
manly, and therefore anxious about the result? not a
being full of whim and prejudice, receiving the opinions
from the past and referring to numbers as proof; who
prides himself on his self-reliance and his absence of
pride, and yet who can be won by agreeing with him
and through diplomacy? not one who endeavors to
prove to you the correctness of his views by argument
in the endeavor to win you over to his side, in order that
that side may be strengthened? not one in whose
mouth there is continually a large capital I, or who
has a bad case of egomania and studiously avoids all
mention of himself?</p>

<p>But what I mean is a man every whit whole, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens
sana in corpora sano</i>, who is afraid of no man and of
whom no man is afraid, to whom the word ‘fear’ is unknown.
Prize fighters sometimes boast that they are
without fear, but there is one thing they are afraid of,
and that is <em>fear</em>. Fear is the great disturber. It causes
all physical ills (Yes, I know what I say.) and it robs
us of our heavenly birthright. What is the cause of
fear? Sin, and if your education had been begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
at the right time and in the right way, you might now
be without sin&mdash;that is, without fear. Begin the right
education now, and in time you will come into possession
of your heritage; for you are an immortal spirit,
dwelling in this body which to-morrow you may slip
off; and all the right education you have acquired will
still be yours, for as in matter there is nothing lost, so
in spirit nothing is destroyed.</p>

<p>When you stand in the presence of a man you will
know it by the holy calm that comes stealing over you.
His presence will put you at your ease&mdash;with no effort to
please and yet without indifference. Both can remain
silent without there being an awkward pause or any embarrassment.
The atmosphere he will bring will clothe
you as with a garment, and though your sins be as scarlet
you will make no effort to dissemble, to excuse, to explain,
or to apologize. You will find this man is no longer
young, for youth is restless and ambitious, and although
he fears not death, nor scarcely thinks of it, yet lives as
though this body was immortal.</p>

<p>I lived under the same roof with The Man one day in
each week for two months, and words utterly fail me
when I endeavor to describe him, for how can I describe
to you the Ideal?</p>

<p>At first I thought him an old man, for his luxuriant
hair and full wavy beard were snowy white; but the face,
tanned by exposure to the winds, was free from wrinkles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and had the bright anticipatory joyous look of youth; eyes,
large, brown and lustrous, looking through and through
one, but yet the glance was not piercing, for it spoke of
love and sympathy and not of curiosity or aggression;
form, strong and athletic; hands, calloused by work;
yet this man, strong, brown, with throat bared to the
breast, seemed to have the strength of an athlete yet
the gentleness of a woman, the high look of wisdom,
and with his whole demeanor the composure of Plato. God
had breathed into his nostrils and he had become a living
soul.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII_FIRST_SUNDAY_A_LOOK_AROUND" id="CHAPTER_VIII_FIRST_SUNDAY_A_LOOK_AROUND">CHAPTER VIII.<br /><span class="largefont">FIRST SUNDAY&mdash;A LOOK AROUND.</span></a></h2>


<p>“The roads are very muddy, friend,” the man began,
“you had better stay here until to-morrow and return on
the morning train. This is the day of rest. What a
beautiful word that is, ‘rest’! There is no feverish
tossing and longing for the morning to him who has
worked rightly, only sweet rest. The heart rests between
beats. See how restful and calm the landscape
is,” and we looked out over the dripping woodland where
the drops sparkled like gems in the bright sunshine.
“Nature rests, yet ever works; accomplishing, but is
never in haste. Man only is busy. Nature is active,
for rest is not idleness. As I sit here in the quietness,
my body is taking in new force, my pulse beats regularly,
calmly, surely. The circulation of the blood is
doing its perfect work by throwing off the worthless
particles and building up the tissue where needed. So
rest is not rust. While we rest we are taking on board a
new cargo of riches. My best thoughts have been
whispered to me while sitting at rest, or idle, as men
would say. I sit and wait, and all good things are
mine, ‘for lo! mine own shall come to me.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus did The Man speak in a low but most beautiful
voice, and the music of that voice lingers with me still
and will as long as life shall last. I seemed to have lost
my will in that of The Man. I neither decided I would
stay or go, but I simply remained. I am not what is
called religious&mdash;far from it&mdash;for I have been a stumbling-block
for every pastor and revivalist at both Grace
Church and Delaware avenue. Neither have I any special
liking for metaphysics, but I hung like a drowning
person to every word The Man said; and after all it
was not what he said, although I felt the sublime truth
of his words, but it was what there was back. I knew,
down deep in my soul, that this man possessed a power
and was in direct communication with a Something of
which other men knew not.</p>

<p>I have traveled much, and studied mankind in every
clime, for before my father’s failure we went abroad
every year. I know well the sleek satisfied look of success
which marks the prosperous merchant; I know the
easy confidence of the man satisfied with his clothes; I
have seen the serenity of the orator secure in his position
through the plaudits of his hearers; I know the
actor who has never heard a hiss; the look of beauty on
the face of the philanthropist, who can minister to his
own happiness by relieving from his bountiful store the
sore needs of others; the lawyer, sure of his fee, or the
husband who knows he is king of one loving heart and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
therefore is able to defy the world;&mdash;but here was a man
alone seemingly, without friends, in the wilderness, in a
house devoid of ornament and almost destitute of furniture,
whose raiment was of the coarsest; yet here in the
face of this man I saw the look that told not of earthly
success dependent on men or things, but of riches laid
up “where moth and rust cannot corrupt, and where
thieves do not break through and steal.”</p>

<p>We sat in silence for perhaps an hour and then The
Man spoke.</p>

<p>“Friend, I have called you here. You know that
spirit attracts spirit, and once we know how, we attract
at will. This secret you shall know. I have somewhat
to give to the world. You must come here each Saturday
and stay here during the day of rest. I could have
gone to you, but the city is full of distractions and the
lower thought-currents there render you less sensitive to
truth; so here in this grove, God’s temple, I will teach,
that you may go forth as a laborer in the vineyard
where the harvest shall be not yet, but will be reaped by
those who come after. You are a stenographer. Bring
pencils and paper, and each Sunday I will give you a
little of the truth that you are to publish in a book and
give out to dying men, for the world must be saved.
Men never needed truth and teachers as much as now. I
do not preach nor write, but I act through others, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
during the past hundred years I have told to men many
things which they have given to the world.”</p>

<p>“A hundred years?” I asked, astonished; and it was
the first feeling of surprise I had felt.</p>

<p>The Man smiled faintly and said:</p>

<p>“Yes; three hundred years have I lived in this body.
I was born in 1591. Why do you wonder? Have you
no faith in God? You see miracles on every hand, and
yet you now are ready to doubt. The oyster mends its
shell with pearls: some unthinking person twists off the
claw of a cray-fish, and you watch another spring forth
and grow to full size, and yet you doubt that a man can
retain his strength indefinitely!</p>

<p>“We die through violation of law. This violation is
through ignorance, or is wilful. If we do away with
ignorance and are willing to obey, we can live as long
as we wish. Men only die when they are not fit to live.
As long as a person’s body is useful, God preserves it.
The body is renewed completely every seven years.
This you were taught in school. Why should not this
renewal continue? An infant has cartilage, but very little
bone. Gradually the cartilage ossifies, until in old age
the bones are brittle. This is caused by the deposits of
lime which are being continually taken into the system.
There is constant waste and constant repair in the human
body. You know this full well, and you know
that at night and in moments of repose the repair exceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the waste. So where you were tired and ready to
faint an hour ago, you are now strong.</p>

<p>“When I was thirty years of age, and my body at its
strongest and best, I adopted a simple plan of keeping
the excess lime and deteriorating substances out of my
system; so you see my flesh is strong yet, soft, for the
muscles should not be hard and tense, but pliable. My
bones are not brittle, but cartilage is everywhere where
needed to form cushions for the articulations. I have
not known pain for a century, for nature does her perfect
work and the dead tissue is constantly carried off and
replaced with new. Pain generally comes from deposits
left in the body when they should be carried off. Rheumatism,
you know, is only a deposit in the linings of the
muscles; but I never think of my body until the subject
is brought to my attention, and do not like to talk
of it, as the theme is not profitable; but later I will
tell you when you are able to understand, how to have
the body throw off those excess substances and renew
itself without limit.”</p>

<p>Now lest some of my readers who are very young
should imagine I was “in love” with this man let me
say&mdash;not so! In the presence of The Man sex was lost.
He was to me neither man nor woman, yet both; although
he had that glorious faculty of joyous anticipation,
which we see in children&mdash;so he was not only
man and woman, but child. Yet in wisdom I felt him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to be a prophet, and I myself was but a child. For
after all we are but grown up children, and the difference
between some grown people is no greater than
that found among children and some men.</p>

<p>With this man I was a child, and he seemed to regard
me so, yet never talked down to me, and I have
since discovered that sensible people do not talk baby
talk to children, nor do they talk down to people who
they imagine ignorant. Men who do this reverse the
situation and become veritable ignorami themselves.</p>

<p>Old John Foster, the horse-trainer, used to break
horses for my father, and one day old John said to me,
“Young lady, when you breaks a colt, don’t get scared
yerself and then the colt won’t. Hitch him up just
like he was an old hoss, and he will think he is one
and go right along and never know when he was broke.”</p>

<p>Some men always change the conversation when a
woman enters, thinking the subject too weighty for her
comprehension; and in ‘sassiety’ they still talk soft
nonsense to women because they think women like it;
and lots of women have adopted the same idea, and
have accepted the same creed&mdash;that they do know nothing
and always will, and that scientific subjects, like
Plymouth Rock pants, are for men folks.</p>

<p>Not long ago, you remember, we had a preacher who
gave a series of sermons to <em>men</em> only, and a friend of
mine who attended tells me the reverend divine gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
those men more ‘pointers’ in depravity than they could
have guessed alone in a dozen years.</p>

<p>But pardon this diversion and let me simply say,
that to educate the heart and conscience, you must not
separate men from women, nor make foolish distinctions
between the ignorant and the cultured. We are all
God’s children, and it is all God’s truth, and this is
God’s world.</p>

<p>The Man told me this, and much more in that delightful
day of rest, and he seemed to make no distinction
between my childish ignorance and his own unfathomed
wisdom. So the sense of weakness was never
thrust upon me, and all during that day I seemed to
grow in spirit. There came a greater self-respect, a
reverence for my own individuality (you will not misunderstand
me), an increased universality, a broader outlook,
a wider experience. It was only one day as men
count time, but I had lived&mdash;lived a century.</p>

<p>Monday morning came. After breakfast The Man
arose and said:</p>

<p>“I will go with you, and get the bicycle.” (How did
he know? I had not told him anything of my ride).
“You can take the train from Jamison, which is about
two miles from here. We can soon walk there.”</p>

<p>We found the wheel in the bushes, where I had left
it by the roadside, and the man pushed it ahead of him
with one hand through the mud, walking at a rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
easy stride, arriving at the station just as the train
pulled up. My benefactor lifted the bicycle lightly into
the baggage-car, bought me a ticket, handed it to me,
smiled and was gone. He did not say good-bye. I did
not thank him for his kindness, and in fact, not a word
was spoken after we left the little log house.</p>

<p>Albert Love, the conductor, I knew, as I often rode on
his train. Helping me on the car, he laughingly said:</p>

<p>“Ah, you got caught in the storm and couldn’t get
back, could you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to,” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh! ah! Relative?” nodding his head in the direction
of the retreating form of The Man.</p>

<p>“Yes; uncle.”</p>

<p>“Hem&mdash;they call him a crank here.&mdash;’Ll’board.”</p>

<p>I hurried from the depot to the office, and was only an
hour behind time.</p>

<p>“You are late,” said Mr. Hustler, with a cynical,
sickly smile which looked much like a scowl. “Only
an hour. Make a note of it and give it to the time-keeper.”</p>

<p>I began my work and seemed to possess the strength
of two women. My fingers struck the keys of the typewriter
like lightning, and my head was clearer than ever
before. When I took up a letter to answer, I saw clear
through it, and struck the vital point at once; and yet
all the time there was before me the mild and receptive
face of The Man. The strange experience I had gone
through was ever in my mind, and yet the work never
disappeared from my desk as well and rapidly before.
Where is that old philosopher who said, “The mind cannot
think of two things at one time”?</p>

<p>At home I found my mother had waited tea for me
until nine o’clock, when Martha Heath entered, and seeing
the untouched supper and the look of despair on my
mother’s face, knew the situation at a glance; for if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
smart woman cannot divine a thing, she will never,
<em>never</em>, <span class="smcap">NEVER</span>, understand it when told.</p>

<p>Martha Heath came to see Aspasia Hobbs, but Martha
Heath did not ask for Aspasia Hobbs. She glanced
at the face of the trembling old lady, who was trying
to keep back the flood, saw the untasted supper, and
Martha Heath then and there told a lie:</p>

<p>“Oh, I just dropped in to tell you Aspasia had gone
home with one of the girls who was a little nervous, and
perhaps would stay over Sunday with her. Who made
your new dress, Mrs. Hobbs? Now don’t you feel big!
You are so fond of appearing in print that you always
wear calico!”</p>

<p>And the laugh that followed was catching, and even
the good old grizzled Grimes felt the tension gone and she
too chuckled. All three women sat down to tea, and
Martha Heath ate supper again, although she had eaten
at home before, and they chatted and the visitor talked
a little more than was necessary. She told how she had
that afternoon ran her bicycle into a nearsighted dude,
who was chasing his hat, and how she not only upset the
dude but ran over his hat; and how the dude called on
a policeman to arrest her, but the policeman said he
“darsen’t tackle the gal alone.” The mother forgot her
troubles and the Grimes laughed so that she upset her
tea, and when Martha Heath said “Good-bye girls,” they
all laughed again, and Grimes wiped her brass-rimmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
spectacles with the corner of a big check apron and said,
“Now ain’t she a queer un? and so kind too for her to
come clear down here to tell us ’Pasia wasn’t killed
entirely!”</p>

<p>Gentle and pious reader, you would not tell a lie,
would you? Oh, no! But, Martha Heath had faith in
me. I am self-reliant, strong, and able to take care of
myself, and homely enough, thank Heaven! so I am no
longer ogled on the street by blear eyed idlers. Martha
Heath knows all this. She believes in me. Martha
Heath has faith in Providence&mdash;have you?</p>

<p>Well, the work did fly! “Everything goes,” said
Hustler as he looked on approvingly. Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, and some way I grew a little
more thoughtful; not nervous, but serious. Friday
night I scarcely slept an hour. It seemed as if I was
about to depart to another and better world. At breakfast
Saturday morning my mother said:</p>

<p>“It was a week ago to-day, Aspasia!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” I said, inwardly.</p>

<p>“A week ago to-day! And now, never try to kill your
old mother who loves you just the same whether you
love her or not, by going off without telling us. Why, if
Martha Heath hadn’t come and told us where you was,
I would have died before morning. It was awful
thoughtless of her too, not to have come here at once.
She ought not to have put it off until ten o’clock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>It was only nine, but we like to make our troubles as
great as possible, for greater credit then is ours for bearing
them.</p>

<p>I arose, kissed my good mother, and said: “Yes, I
will always tell you myself hereafter when I am to be
away&mdash;and so I tell you now. I am going away every
Saturday to be gone over Sunday from now until October.”</p>

<p>“‘How sharper than a rattlesnake’s tooth it is to
have a thankless child,’ the Bible says, and after all I
have done for you too! Oh, it is too much to think
my only child should thus desert me in my old age, and
go off nobody knows where, and disgrace us all! Disgrace
us, disgrace us, dis&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It was too much, and she covered her face with her
hands and burst into tears, rocking to and fro. Here
Mrs. Grimes broke in with:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hobbs, will you never&mdash;! Why, ’Pasia has
more sense than all of us. She ain’t no fool. She ain’t&mdash;Why,
didn’t I come three weeks lackin’ two days afore
she was born, and didn’t I wash and dress her myself?”
The gentle Grimes always availed herself of the opportunity
to tell of my birth, to cut off any quibbler who
might state I was not the child of Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs.
“Mrs. Hobbs, you are a fool, and if ’Pasia ever does a
bad thing it’ll be ’cause you drives her to it. I don’t
know where she’s goin’, and dam if I care! I’ll trust her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
anywhere! Go on, ’Pasia, and stay a year. You’ll find
us here when you comes back.”</p>

<p>The Grimes cyclone had cleared the atmosphere, the
rain had ceased, although the landscape was a trifle
disheveled. I kissed the dear mother, grabbed my
lunch-bag, and was gone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X_SECOND_SUNDAY_TO_THE_WOODS_AWAY" id="CHAPTER_X_SECOND_SUNDAY_TO_THE_WOODS_AWAY">CHAPTER X.<br /><span class="largefont">SECOND SUNDAY&mdash;TO THE WOODS AWAY.</span></a></h2>


<p>I hurried through my work, dusted off the desk,
locked the typewriter, and at two o’clock mounted my
bicycle, went straight out Seneca street, over the iron
bridge, on out the plank road, past Wendlings, through
Springbrook, and stopped then for the first time, and
standing on a rising slope of ground, I looked around in
every direction. The dandelions seemed to cover the
earth as with a carpet, and great masses of white hawthorn-trees
in bridal array decked the landscape. The
trees were bursting into leaf, and through the silence
there came the drowsy hum of insects, and away off in
the distance I could just detect the tinkle of a cowbell.
To the left, two miles away, I saw a dense wood which
seemed to transform the hill on which it stood into a
great green mound.</p>

<p>“Yes, that surely is the place,” I said. I followed
the plank road a mile further, then turned into a road
which seemed like two paths side by side, as a line of
green sward filled the centre of the roadway. I came
to the wood, let down the bars, and back in the clearing
was the log house, and out under the spreading branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of a great oak sat The Man. He smiled the same sweet
smile and motioned me to a seat beside him, and together
we sat in silence. The calm and rest seemed
complete.</p>

<p>“Let us sit here under the trees,” said The Man, “and
I will explain several things which you must understand
before I make known the higher truths which you
are to give to mankind.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you have wondered why I do not go out
into the world and teach face to face; and my reason,
friend, for not doing this, is because I must needs disguise
myself, if I go among the people. They would
not comprehend me, but would shout, ‘Crucify him!
Crucify him!’ as they did in the days of old. If I
should go into the city and teach as the Master did,
can you imagine the headlines in the Sunday papers?
I would have followers of course, but even
they would misunderstand me and quarrel among themselves
about who should be the greatest in the Kingdom
of Heaven. Many of them would fall down and worship
me, and when I passed out of their sight there
would be an ever-increasing number who would deify
me, confounding my personality with that of a God,
while the power I possess is possible for all men. They
would say I was not a man but a ‘supreme being.’ On
my metaphor they would construct a system of theology,
and would use my words as a fence to hedge in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and limit truth, instead of accepting my principles as a
broad base on which they might build a tower to touch
the skies.</p>

<p>“A modern prophet has said, ‘I am astonished at the
incredible amount of Judaism and formalism which still
exists nineteen centuries after the Redeemer’s proclamation.’
‘It is the letter that killeth,’ after his protest
against the use of a dead symbolism.</p>

<p>“The new religion, which is the old, is so profound
that it is not understood even now, and is a blasphemy
to the greater number of professing Christians. The
person of Christ is the centre of it. Redemption, eternal
life, divinity, humanity, propitiation, judgment,
Satan, heaven and hell&mdash;all these beliefs have been so
materialized and coarsened that with a strange irony
they present to us the spectacle of things having a
profound meaning and yet carnally interpreted. Christian
boldness and Christian liberty must be reconquered.
It is the Church that is heretical; the Church it is
whose soul is troubled and whose heart is timid.
Whether we will or no there is an esoteric doctrine&mdash;there
is a direct revelation, ‘Each man enters into God
so much as God enters into him.’</p>

<p>“They would call me a heretic, and you must remember
the heretic is one with faith plus. I do not limit
faith to this and that, but extend it to all things. Not
only is Sunday holy, but all time is holy. The chancel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
is no more sacred than the pew. The world is God’s
and all, everything is sacred to His use&mdash;our needs are
His use.</p>

<p>“They would literalize my tropes to suit their own
prejudices, and still insisting I was a god, distort my
meaning in order to give a show of reason to their own
wrong acts. This has been done over and over, as history
tells you.</p>

<p>“Osiris, Thor, Memnon, Jupiter, Apollo, Gautama,
and many others I could name of whom you know,
were strong and brave men who lived on earth and bestowed
great benefits on mankind; but ignorant and
headstrong people, not content that these great men
should live out their simple lives&mdash;for the great are
simple, and pass for what they are&mdash;destroyed to a
certain extent their good influence by affirming them to
be not men at all; and to prove their statements, as untruthful
people ever do strain heaven and earth to prove
their allegations, they invented many stories and plans,
such as that the great man was born in a ‘<em>miraculous</em>’
way&mdash;as if the natural birth was not miracle enough!&mdash;there
being at the time a most erroneous idea that the
act of vitalization was vicious and wrong, and this
barbaric idea still remains with us to a certain extent.</p>

<p>“You remember in olden time priests (men who were
believed to be in direct communication with Deity) were
supposed to have power to grant absolution&mdash;that is, to
forgive sin&mdash;and these granted indulgences; that is, leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
for the person to perform certain sinful acts, and by paying
a certain sum to the priests no punishment was inflicted
upon the sinner. The physical relations of the
sexes were supposed by these heathen to be sinful (and
indeed they certainly are under wrong conditions!) where
the symbolic meaning is lost sight of, but like other
sacraments, most holy when performed in right spirit, as
symbolizing a perfect union of spirit, a complete giving
up and surrender of <em>soul to soul</em>; and many men now,
having stood with a woman before a priest and made
certain promises, and having paid this priest a sum of
money, believe that they have certain rights over this
woman; and some women, I am sorry to say, believe
too that it is their duty to submit to a loveless embrace
thus desecrating the body, which is the temple of the
Most High. And as it is a law of God that sin cannot
go unpunished, you see the almost endless misery
this transgression entails.</p>

<p>“Sin can only be wiped out with suffering. No community,
scarcely a house is free from this taint; and yet
up to to-day, no public teacher (we need teachers not
preachers), has lifted his voice or used pen to right this
wrong which men and women in their blindness have
pulled down on themselves; but in fact men have been
continually fixed in the wrong by the encouragement
given to marriages of expediency and a multitude of
unavowable motives, all of which are supposed to be consecrated
by the religious ceremony.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI_IS_IT_SO" id="CHAPTER_XI_IS_IT_SO">CHAPTER XI.<br /><span class="largefont">IS IT SO?</span></a></h2>


<p>This was all so new to me that on Sunday morning
I began the conversation by asking:</p>

<p>“What, you do not wish to do away with the sacredness
of marriage and establish free love in its place?”</p>

<p>The Man was silent for a moment, then turned on me
his gentle gaze and I was answered. I was going to
apologize for the interruption, but The Man continued:</p>

<p>“Friend, I know what I have left unsaid. No living
soul on earth to-day appreciates the vital importance
and the sacredness of the true marriage as completely as
I, and although I may touch briefly on certain subjects,
you must not think I have spoken all there is to be
said on the subject, for I know all spiritual laws&mdash;all natural
law is spiritual, for behind each material fact stands
the spiritual Truth.</p>

<p>“The universe is a whole, made up of parts. I know
the relation of these parts to each other, and also the
relation of parts to the whole. All knowledge is mine
back to the First Great Cause, behind which no man
can go, but still I am not without hope even of that.
Now you of course can not comprehend all I will tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
you, but do not combat it. To attempt to refute, mentally
or verbally, is to close the valves of the intellect so
that you cannot receive. Those who endeavor to controvert
use any weapon that is at hand, truth or error,
to accomplish their purpose.</p>

<p>“I know lawyers who pride themselves on their ability
to controvert any statement any man can make, and
I also see that the Chautauqua <cite>Herald</cite> in endeavoring to
complimentarily describe the Rev. Doctor Buckley,
speaks of him as a controversialist. The controversionalist
is a controversialist, and rushes in to test his steel as
quickly with truth as with error. However, he is diplomatic,
and endeavors not to kill the pet knight of his
queen&mdash;Popular Opinion.</p>

<p>“Avoid controversy as you would a venomous snake.
If you cultivate it you will find yourself constantly
forming a rebuttal whenever you converse. Thus you
lose all grasp on truth, and keep yourself ever outside of
Heaven’s gate.</p>

<p>“Sit quietly, put prejudice, jealousy and malice out of
your way, ever cultivate the receptive mood and you will
only receive the good. Life should be reception, just as
the oyster with shell partially open receives the waves
bearing its food. What it needs is absorbed; what is
not is washed away by the same force that brought it.
Do not be afraid of receiving that which is harmful.
Have faith&mdash;we are in God’s hand and He doeth all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
things well. Does the oyster fear being poisoned? If
you cannot accept what I say let it pass. Much that I
tell you, you can absorb; if you do not need the rest the
tide will bear it back all in good time.</p>

<p>“All violence of direction in will or belief is harmful
and wrong, for man is only the medium of truth.
He should be a prism, which receiving the great ray of
light coming from the one Source of all life and light,
reflects all the beauties of the rainbow, the symbol of
promise, never omitting the actinic ray. It is within
the reach of every man to so mirror the beauty and
goodness of the Infinite, and there is no success short
of this. Over the temple at Delphi was the inscription&mdash;‘Know
Thyself.’ Over the temple of our hearts let
us write the words in white and gold&mdash;‘Trust Thyself.’</p>

<p>“Again, you must believe when I say I know what is
left unsaid. Truth is paradoxical, for it holds its perfect
poise by the opposition of two forces, just as the earth
lies in the soft arms of the atmosphere, poised between
centrifugal and centripetal attraction.</p>

<p>“Now I have touched lightly on a few things, just to
show you how men in their blindness and hot haste have
perverted the good. Eyes accustomed to live in darkness
are dazzled when they come to the light, and this
partially explains why the great are misunderstood.
Men measure them by their little foot rule, which is
either six inches or two feet long, and while opinions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
are divided as to whether the man is a genius or a fool,
the majority decide in favor of the latter; but still there
are many who, not content in seeing the wonders he
performs needs must attribute to him powers which he
does not possess. Man now speaks to his friend by word
of mouth over a thousand miles of space. The voice
with all its peculiar inflections and intonations, is heard
and recognized. We know that this is in accordance with
natural law, but if the secret was known only to one
man, and the rest of us were in ignorance as to the process,
we would attribute to that man supernatural powers;
and when he died many would relate not only how
they heard the voice coming from a thousand miles
away, but how they also saw the man jump the entire
distance, and many other fables would be invented as to
the wonderful acts of this man.</p>

<p>“Now I am in possession of powers which work all
smoothly in accordance with natural law, but which you
would deem miraculous; but some day you and others
will avail yourselves of these same laws, just as your
voice can be recorded, bottled up and carried across the
ocean in a box, and your body may die and the record
of your voice still be preserved and the sounds brought
forth at will from this little roll of gelatine. A year
hence I will be many miles away, and you will be at
home or walking in the fields, and I will speak to you
and you will answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, have you guessed why I do not reveal myself
to the rabble and scatter my pearls before swine? I
teach through others, giving them a little truth at a
time, and they send it forth. I choose women to carry
my messages, for they are more sensitive to truth&mdash;more
alive&mdash;more impressionable! Men are aggressive and
bent on conquest&mdash;their desire is for place and power,
and to be seen and heard of men. But even this has its
place, although low down in the scale&mdash;is one of the
rounds in the spiral of evolution; and all in His own
good time men shall be taught, but the work must be
done by women. As we are taught in the old fable&mdash;which,
by the way, is founded on truth&mdash;that through
woman man fell, so shall woman lead him back to Eden;
and even now I see the glorious dawn which betokens
the sunrise.</p>

<p>“You now know why I have called you, and you understand
too why I cannot afford to run the risk of partial
present failure&mdash;for in God’s plans there is no failure&mdash;by
standing before men. I am speaking to many
other writers and speakers. Even as I sit here in this
beautiful grove, telling them what to say, they are going
forth over the whole world preaching the gospel to
every creature. You have been surprised possibly to
hear of men speaking the same truth at the same time
in different parts of the world&mdash;now you know how it
has come about. Your soul has not yet been quickened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
into life, so I cannot speak with you excepting through
this slow and crude man-contrivance which we call
language; but there will soon come a time when we can
lay this aside, and you will no longer be a captive to
these tethering conditions; for you shall know the
truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</p>

<p>So spake The Man, and the stars came out one by one
as the daylight died out of the sky, and I sat and seemed
filled to overflowing with wondering awe.</p>

<p>“Now take your note-book and pencil and let us take
a little look out over the world and see things as they
are,” The Man said. “You will then better understand
what I will say later.</p>

<p>“The struggling march of Progress is marked on the
map of human history by a deep continuous stain of
red, but to-day we hear King William apologizing for
his vast army by saying it is maintained not for war,
but to preserve the peace of Europe.</p>

<p>“In twenty years the population of the United States
has increased from forty to sixty-five millions, and our
standing army has decreased in like proportion.</p>

<p>“We are no longer able to sleep soundly after a man
is hanged, and the dreams have been so hateful that several
states have done away entirely with capital punishment,
and the balance are searching restlessly for a more
humane (?) method of killing. We have tried electrocution,
because some one said that the man who killed
and the man who got killed would never know anything
about it; and here in New York they passed a law declaring
that the people should not know anything about
the killing either, and that any newspaper publisher who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
described this killing should be adjudged guilty of felony.
Now, we are not satisfied with the death-dealing
work of the subtle fluid; but if put to a popular vote
with the aid of a secret ballot, we should say emphatically
to judge and jury, ‘Thou shalt not kill.’</p>

<p>“This increased sensitiveness which we see manifest
on the question thus referred to, finds vent in a thousand
varied forms. Prisons are no longer places of punishment
but of discipline; the birch is no longer the chief
factor in imparting ideas to the young&mdash;we make the
application not to the anatomy, but to the understanding,
and if we still believe the child is totally depraved, we
are a little ashamed of the belief and say nothing about
it. The woman who lolls in her carriage is not quite
comfortable, for her mind is alive to the fact that others
are trudging, footsore and weary, carrying heavy burdens.
Benevolence has become the fashion, and ‘Fresh
Air Funds’ are actually talked of on ’Change. On
every hand we hear of Societies of Christian Endeavor,
the Chautauqua Idea, Ethical Culture, Kindergartens,
not for uppertendom, but for the infected district where
violence, disease, strife and discord have before reigned.
Every preacher of every denomination indulges the
larger hope (possibly there are obscure exceptions), and
quotes as corroborating his argument the seers, prophets
and poets who were before denounced from the very
pulpit in which he now preaches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are hearing much of heresy just now, but the
‘guilty’ man is not disgraced; on the contrary, his
crime places him before a larger audience at double salary;
and, if one may be allowed to say it, there is a
general belief abroad that some heretics have courted
their persecution. Certainly we do not try them for
what they said, but the way they said it. A man who
was a heretic twenty years ago, now finds himself orthodox,
for there is faith plus in both pulpit and pew, and
the heretic is generally a man of limitless faith. We
believe not only that Jesus Christ was the son of God,
but all men are or can be if they claim their heritage;
not one day in seven is holy, but all are; not that certain
places are consecrated, but all is consecrated ground,
and that evil is only perverted good, or absence of good,
just as darkness is absence of light. These things we
hear from every pulpit without surprise.</p>

<p>“Prize fighters use six-ounce gloves, and women endowed
with police powers act in behalf of societies for
the prevention of cruelty to animals and children. Matrons
are to be found in jails and station houses, and the
maxim that ‘Might makes right’ has been reversed.
Never was the tear of pity so near the surface, and the
change of which I speak has been brought about largely
since 1870. In these twenty-one years the flinty heart
of man has been softened more than in the three hundred
years preceding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now we are approaching the vital question, for I
propose to tell you why this change has come; why our
faces are now turned toward Zion. The answer I give
is not given out off-hand, but after most careful thought
and study for many, many years. <em>The spirit of the time
has changed by and through the influence of woman.</em></p>

<p>“The real essence of sex is spiritual; and as behind
every physical fact there is a spiritual truth, so above
and beyond this sexual instinct is the most sacred and
divinest gift given to man. In the encyclopedias we
read that this inclination ‘has its purpose in reproduction
of the species.’ And is Nature after all but a trickster?
a practical joker? Is this fair dream of holy
peace and joy of being at last understood by a some
one, loving, gentle, tender, true, in whose presence one
may think aloud and be at rest? Is this after all but a
scheme for the reproduction of our kind? When we
consider what the kind is, is reproduction of the kind
the highest good? Even good men have thought so;
and for the misuse of God’s more sacred gift man was
put out of Eden and has wandered far. The return will
be slow, and it must be by the way he came. There
is no other way. The monastery is as bad a failure as
the house of Camille. Only by a knowledge of the right
relation of men and women can we gain Heaven.</p>

<p>“You see me, the possessor of all knowledge, and
Heaven is mine&mdash;for Heaven is not a place, but a condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of mind. Seemingly I am alone, for your physical
eye sees no one near; but she is ever by me&mdash;I feel her
hand now as it rests lightly on my head. Friend, I am
what I am through the love of woman. Love is life.</p>

<p>“There is a class of women who especially have my
sincere and profound respect, these are the ‘old maids.’
They form to-day in this country a genuine sisterhood
of mercy. They do the work no one else will do nor
can do. In every village there are aged parents, orphan
children, widowed brothers, helpless invalids, people
homeless and friendless who owe a debt of gratitude
which time can never repay to the unselfish devotion of
some old maid. They are women who will not fling
their womanhood away for the sake of a ‘provider,’ or
to escape the supposed ignominy of maidenhood. If a
woman once decides she must have a man, by just spreading
her net, and not being over-choice about quality, she
can always secure some sort of game, for no matter how
foolish, frivolous and vain a woman is, there is a man
near at hand who will out-match her. I am glad to
know that the number of old maids is increasing, for a
woman had a thousand times over better travel through
life alone than to accept any alliance short of her genuine
mental and spiritual mate. This may give you a clue to
the reason for the well known fact that the average old
maid excels in intelligence and culture her married
sister. When a man marries the wrong woman it is a
mistake, for the woman it is a blunder.”</p>

<p>I sat with note-book on my knee, pencil in hand and
The Man began:</p>

<p>“The air here on this hillside is full of health and healing.
Physical life you know is only possible in a right
atmosphere. Add five parts more of carbonic acid gas
and the body is poisoned&mdash;ceases to act&mdash;dies! Do you
see the change in the constituent parts of the air? No&mdash;your
senses are not aware of any change at all if the
poison is introduced gradually; and so the use of the
electric light in hotels has worked a great saving of life
among the rural population, for the most frantic effort to
blow it out proves futile; but in days gone by scarcely
a month passed in any city when some innocent and
ignorant individual did not lock the door, close the
window, vitiate his physical atmosphere, and glide off
slowly, surely, into that sleep which we call death.</p>

<p>“In the carboniferous period there was no atmosphere
capable of sustaining animal life. Vegetation was
flowerless, and the trees grew rank in swamps filled with
poisonous miasma, death and gloom. No flowers decked
the earth or the tree tops, no fruit hung on the branches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the song of birds was not heard and the only animal life
was made up of mollusks and the lower forms of animate
existence. Gradually the carbon in the air was
absorbed by the vegetation, and sank beneath the bending
swale, and new trees grew, and others followed still,
and these sank and sank again, carrying down into the
depths the material that has formed the shining coal
which warms and cheers our homes.</p>

<p>“Gradually this purifying process continued; more
and many kinds of plants sprang into being; these too
absorbed the poison from the air, fit preparation that
earth might receive her king. Animal life appeared
in monster shape; fierce, awful forms, that crawled
upon the land, through tangled swamps, or swam
the sea, thriving in the atmosphere of slime&mdash;of gloom&mdash;of
death. Gradually these nightmare forms have
passed away, leaving only grim remains and foot-prints
here and there, from which ingenious men have guessed
the right proportion of the whole. Finer and finer,
better and better grows the teeming life of animal and
flower, until in words of prophet told,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="indentone">“‘Sweet is the breath of morn,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Her rising sweet with song of earliest birds;</div>
<div class="indentbase">Pleasant the sun, when first on this delightful morn</div>

<div class="indentbase">Fragrant the fertile earth after soft showers,</div>
<div class="indentbase">And sweet the coming on of grateful evening mild.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Man seemed musing to himself instead of talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to me, and I thought he had been talking without special
point, for he was now silent, seated with back toward
me, looking from the window; but it came to me like a
flash without his explaining in words that the glimpse
he had given of the history of the earth was only a
summing up of the history of the soul of man. I saw
the hordes of barbarians intent on conquest come streaming
out from back of Assyria over into Macedonia, into
Greece. I saw the teeming millions of Persia sink
struggling beneath the sinking swale, and Greece come
forth with men noble, gentle, refined, compared with
what men were before them. Rome appeared, and I
thought surely the carboniferous period was coming
back with its poisonous fumes when Cæsar passed over
into Gaul, then Britanny.</p>

<p>For centuries the earth gave forth no sign; but suddenly
I saw a woman&mdash;not an ideal one to be sure, but
men lifted their hats to the Virgin Queen, and with the
Elizabethan age came a Spencer and a Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Surely the flowers had begun to bloom, the woods
were full of song of birds, and I knew The Man was
thinking of the What-Is-To-Be when he slowly and
softly repeated the verse I have written. He turned and
looked at me&mdash;our eyes met in firm, gentle embrace.
Perhaps we both smiled, and he knew I understood. I
had made a great stride to the front. He had spoken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
me without words on a subject I had never thought of.
I had received the message and I felt that this was
just the beginning&mdash;only six o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>I knew all he would say of atmosphere&mdash;that if body
can not live excepting in a right atmosphere, neither can
spirit; for over and over had I heard The Man say,
“The material world is only symbol&mdash;behind each physical
fact is a spiritual truth. Each planet has its own
physical atmosphere varying according to its development.”</p>

<p>“Each person carries with him an atmosphere varying
according to his development,” The Man continued,
“and this is why in the presence of some person your
spirit&mdash;that is, your better self&mdash;acts and lives. You
think great and exalted thoughts with this friend.
Neither may say a word, but your heart is full of
love, benevolence and good-will. Now the person
may be a perfect stranger to you, and yet supply
you with an atmosphere in which your spirit may rejoice
and sing. And again, who has not felt in coming into
the presence of others, that the air was filled with the
fumes of sulphur and carbonic acid. You become
morose, downcast, spiteful, discouraged. This is only
because your spirit is now in an unfavorable atmosphere.
Get enough of these people who carry with them a
tainted atmosphere and keep you in their presence, you
will shrink away and die. Thousands upon thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of men and women (women suffer more than men from
bad spiritual atmosphere, as they are more sensitive and
more spiritual) die yearly, and others drag their bodies
about&mdash;living corpses. See them on the street&mdash;these
careworn haggard faces. They die for lack of God’s
sunshine&mdash;their souls are breathing an atmosphere of
hate, distrust, jealousy and cruel ambition.</p>

<p>“This accounts for the great number of cases of insanity
among farmers’ wives. Living as many do, breathing
only the atmosphere of those who are sore labored and
distressed&mdash;or who think they are, which is the same
thing, ‘For as a man thinketh so is he;’ meeting her
husband only in body and not in spirit, it is impossible
for her to generate a strong spiritual atmosphere of her
own. So is it any wonder the soul becomes weary, the
body struggles, cries aloud, totters, reels and falls?</p>

<p>“Good people meeting together, talking of good things,
thinking great thoughts, putting away all strife, envy
and discord, create an atmosphere favorable to spiritual
growth, and make it possible for the souls of all to expand
and reach out, touching Infinity.</p>

<p>“Every wicked thought that flits across the mind is
poisoning the atmosphere which often souls must
breathe, and every good thought you think is adding to
the total sum of good, and whether spoken or unexpressed,
enriches the Universe, for thought is an entity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
producing a vibration too delicate for our dull physical
senses to discern, but our spirits are thus influenced.</p>

<p>“But this is enough. You must rest and then write
out what I have told you. What I will tell you next
Sunday is of much greater import than you have yet
heard me speak.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV_FIFTH_SUNDAY_A_REVELATION" id="CHAPTER_XIV_FIFTH_SUNDAY_A_REVELATION">CHAPTER XIV.<br /><span class="largefont">FIFTH SUNDAY&mdash;A REVELATION.</span></a></h2>


<p>Sunday morning came. The day was perfect. Great
white billowy clouds floated lazily across the face of the
blue ether, a gentle breeze scarcely noticeable stirred
the leaves of the trees, and all nature seemed sublime.
The birds twittered in the pine-trees as we walked beneath,
and the air was saturated with health and healing.</p>

<p>The Man had told me the week before that what he
would tell me to-day was of much importance&mdash;that I
need not write it down at once for I could not forget.
Naturally I was somewhat expectant.</p>

<p>“You have read Shakespeare some of course,” he
began. “Yes, I know, at school, and then you have
seen his plays. This has given you a glimpse of his
mind; but one could study years, certainly much longer
than it took him to write them, and then not get the
full import of Shakespeare’s words. Still, the difference
between your mind and that of Shakespeare is not so
great as one might at first imagine. You yourself think
great thoughts&mdash;they come to you at times in great
waves, almost threatening to engulf you; high and holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
aspirations; sublime impulses, that you dare not attempt
to put in words for mortal ear, for you doubt your own
strength, and also fear you will be misunderstood. So
your best thought is never expressed, for there is no
receptacle where you can pour it out&mdash;you feel that you
go through life alone, so the thought goes through
your brain in the twinkling of a second and is gone
forever.</p>

<p>“All persons think great thoughts&mdash;few have the
power to seize the electric spark and clothe it in words.
Now just to that extent that you understand Shakespeare,
are you his equal. If you see a beautiful thought
recorded and detect its beauty, it was already yours or
you would not have recognized it. It was yours before,
but you never claimed your heritage. That same
thought had gone floating through your brain, either in
this life or a former one, but you failed to hold it fast;
but when it comes back from the lips of the preacher,
or is whispered to you from out pages of a great writer
you say, ‘Ah yes, how true! I have thought the same
thing myself.’</p>

<p>“Now Shakespeare had the faculty (and a more or
less mechanical one it is) of seizing with a grasp as
strong as iron and as soft as silken cord, every sublime
thought that passed through his mind. Your troop of
fancies run wild over the prairies of imagination, mine
and Shakespeare’s are harnessed and bridled. We guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
or lead them where we will; we master them, not they
us. The beautiful thought you rode on like a whirlwind
yesterday, where is it now? You strive to recall
it&mdash;but no, all is dark, misty, and obscure. It has
gone!</p>

<p>“Now under right conditions you can call up these
glowing, prancing thoughts at will, orderly, one at a
time, clean and complete as race horses where each is
led before you by a competent groom; not in a wild
rush of frenzy that leaves you afterward depleted and depressed,
but gently, surely, firmly&mdash;<em>but the conditions must
be right</em>. Now what are these conditions, you ask. Well,
if I describe to you the conditions that surrounded
Shakespeare from the year 1585 when he went to London,
to 1615 when he returned to Stratford, you will
then know what are the right conditions for mental
growth.</p>

<p>“The mother of William Shakespeare, Mary Arden,
was a great and noble woman. Words elude me when
I attempt to describe her! Soul secretes body, and how
can I have you see the dwelling-place of this great and
lofty spirit as I now behold it with my inward eyes?
Tall, rather than otherwise, a willowy lithe form that
was strong as whalebone, yet at first you would have
thought her delicate; hair light, inclining to auburn,
wavy; her eyes heaven’s own blue, with a dreamy far-away
expression, not fixed on things of earth, but looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
into the beyond. She saw things others never saw,
she heard music that came not to the ears of others.
Her face I cannot describe! Some envious women said
she was homely, for her features were rather large and
irregular; but a few saw in that face the look of gentle
greatness, for the really great are always gentle and modest.
They speak with lowered voice&mdash;they hesitate. Is
it fear? They are silent when we say they should affirm&mdash;and
Pilate marveled.</p>

<p>“This woman bore eight children, four boys and four
girls. Only one of these attained eminence&mdash;this was
her third child. The others were born under seemingly
equal favorable circumstances, but the spirit she
called to her when she conceived in that year 1563, was
of a different nature from that which prevailed with the
other seven. She was then thirty-one years old; her
mind working in the direction of the Ideal; her life
calm; all of the surroundings at their best. But we
must hasten on.”</p>

<p>I had brought my stenographic notebook, and almost
from the first I took the words of The Man exact, as I
feared I would not remember them. We were seated on
a log under the great pine-trees, and as The Man talked
slowly, I got the exact words as I give them to you in
this book. The Man continued:</p>

<p>“John Shakespeare was not the equal of his wife by any
means, but a good man withal, who loved his wife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
feared her just a little. She was good and gentle, yet
so self-reliant in spite of her seeming sensitiveness, that
the good man could never fully comprehend her; but he
ever treated her with the awkward yet becoming tenderness
of the great, strong, hairy, simple-hearted man that
he was.</p>

<p>“William caused his parents more trouble and sorrow
than all the other children together. They could not
comprehend him at all. He was smart, yet would not
study; he was strong, yet would not work except by
spells. He would disappear from the task at which he
had been set, and be found lying on his back out under
the trees, looking up through the branches at the great
white clouds floating in the sky. He had hiding-places
all his own in the woods and glens where he would
spend hours alone, and yet in the childish frolics and
games of youth he could always hold his own.</p>

<p>“At eighteen (I hate to think of those awful times)
he married Anne Hathaway, ten years his senior. This
woman was delivered of a child one month after her
marriage. I could tell you the full details of that affair;
of how he married this ignorant and stupid woman to
defend another, but let us pass over it lightly. The
world need not know the bad, it hears too much of it
now. Let us only dwell on the good, think the good,
speak the good, and we will then live the good.</p>

<p>“For three years Shakespeare ostensibly lived with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
this woman, who was whimsical, ignorant, fault-finding,
jealous&mdash;ever upbraiding and too fond of giving
advice, and a most uncleanly and slovenly housekeeper
beside. When he married her Shakespeare accepted
her for better for worse, it proved to be worse, but
he was determined to endure and live it out; but
after three years of purgatory he brushed away the
starting tears, took a few small necessary things, tied
them in a handkerchief, and without saying ‘good-bye’
even to the dear mother whom he loved (although
she did not understand him), started on foot for London,
anxious to lose himself in the great throng. He arrived
penniless, ragged and footsore, and sought vainly for
employment; but what could the poor country boy do?
No trade, no education, no experience with practical
things! If he had been used to the manners of polite
people he could have hired out as a servant; but, alas!
he was only a country boor, unused to city ways, and
driven almost to the verge of starvation, he hung about
the entrance to the theatre, and offered to hold the horses
of visitors who went within. At this he picked up
enough to pay for his scanty food and lodging. Besides
holding horses he carried a lantern, and increased his little
income by attending people home after the play, going
before carrying lantern and staff. London streets, you
know, were not lighted in those days, and robbers were
also plentiful under cover of the night, so strong young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
men able to give protection were needed. Occasionally
he was called into the theatre to act as a soldier or supernumerary.</p>

<p>“One night he was engaged to attend a lady and her
daughter from their home to the play, and back again
after the performance. This woman was the widow of
an Italian nobleman, Bowenni by name, who was driven
from his home for political reasons. He died in London
leaving the widow and daughter with an income which
by prudent management was amply sufficient for their
needs. The daughter was twenty-four years old at the
time I have mentioned, a girl of most rare education and
refinement. Like all Italians she was a born linguist,
and spoke French, German, Greek and Latin with
fluency. Her father was a scholar, and for years he was
the tutor and the only playmate of this daughter. Together
they studied Homer and Plato (the wonders of
Greece were just then for the first time being opened up in
England), and the beauties of the French Moralists they
dissected day by day with ever increasing delight; for the
girl had that fine glad recipiency for the trinity of truth,
beauty and goodness, each of which comprehends the other.
Her father took good care that only the best of mental
nourishment should be hers. In their exile they had
traveled through Egypt, spent months in Denmark, Spain
and Portugal, knew Rome, Venice and the Mediterranean
by heart, and wherever they went, the father secured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
best books of the place&mdash;for you must remember that in
those days the books of an author very seldom went out
of his own country, certainly were never offered for sale
in other countries, and the works of French dramatists
were almost unknown in England.</p>

<p>“After our youth had left the mother and daughter
at the door of their dwelling, and they had entered, the
daughter asked: ‘My mother, didst <a id="Ref_84">thou</a> notice the respectful
attitude of the young man whom we engaged to attend us?&mdash;how
alert he was to see that no accident did befall us?
Yet he spoke no word, nor forced on us attention, but
only seemed intent on his duty doing.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the mother, ‘a youth of goodly parts and
fair to view withal; not large in stature, but strong. He
does not bear himself pompously, and bend back as
other servants do; but the manly chest&mdash;it leads, and
methinks the crown is in its proper place. We will him
engage again, for honest work well done shall ever bring
its own reward.’</p>

<p>“But I must hasten on, and not spend time with mere
detail. Suffice it to say, that the young man was hired
to attend the noble lady and the daughter to the theatre
each Thursday night, and that after four weeks the
daughter suggested that as the young man was so gentlemanly
in his bearing, so modest, and of such comely
features, that there would be no harm for him to attend
them as their friend and escort. ‘No one need know,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
she naïvely said, and after much misgiving on the
mother’s part the plan was suggested to the young man,
who only bowed with uncovered head and said, ‘Madame,
I am your hired servant, and therefore at your
service to do all that you may command, which cannot
be but right.’</p>

<p>“So suitable raiment was purchased, and when the
youth appeared the women were much surprised to see
a perfect gentleman, grave, and ‘to the manor born.’ No
longer now did he hold horses at the entrance, but occasionally
appeared on the stage in a non-speaking part, at
which times the young Italian lady saw but one figure
on the stage. The mother and the young man often
when walking homeward discussed the play, and the
young man seemed to remember each part, and would
repeat entire stanzas when asked to do so, word for word;
and then with no show of egotism but frankly, say ‘It
should have been thus expressed&mdash;or thus.’ To all of
which the mother and daughter made no answer, but
looked at each other in amazement to think that one
who had not traveled, and knew not the ways of courts,
nor had scarcely learned to read, could make amends to
Marlowe.</p>

<p>“One night before the play the manager appeared and
offered five and twenty pounds as reward for the best
play&mdash;all given by the Earl of Southampton. After the
play as they walked home, flushed were the daughter’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
cheeks, and fast beat her heart. Her blood ran high, as
in mad riot. She scarcely seemed to touch the earth as
fast she walked and held fast and fast and tighter still
to the young man’s arm. At last he turned his face&mdash;his
eyes met hers&mdash;her voice came with a bound&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘The play&mdash;the play’s the thing! We’ll write it&mdash;you
and I! The plot? It’s mine already, all in a big
French book, musty and hid away. Yes, the plot we’ll
borrow and give it back again if France demand. Ha&mdash;you,
William, come to-morrow night, and you shall
write it out in your own matchless words while I translate.
The play’s the thing&mdash;the play is the thing!’</p>

<p>“Thus spoke the impetuous Italian girl, and the
mother was much surprised at the wild outburst of her
artless child, but gave assent, and gently the mother
mused in accent low as echo answers voice&mdash;‘The play’s
the thing!’ And the young man to himself, as homeward
he did stroll, did softly say, ‘The play’s the thing!
The play’s the thing!’”</p>

<p>After dinner in the cabin we moved our chairs out
under the trees, and The Man said:</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you wish to hear more about Shakespeare,
but before I tell you more of his personal history,
let us consider two or three facts in reference to
him. First, you know he was not technically a scholar.
Between him and the great ancient hearts he was to read
there intervened no frosty twilight of antiquarian lore.
He had not to clip and measure and adjust amid moth-eaten
cerements and rusty armor that he might be able
to fashion forth the exterior and shell of times long
since gone by, but only to cast asunder the gates of the
human heart, that those deathless notes might be heard
which are the undertone of human emotion in all times.</p>

<p>“Well it was that he who was to give to our tongue
that tune which it was never to lose, whose language,
exhaustless in range, in delicacy, force and extent, taking
every hue of thought or feeling, of good and base
alike, as the sky takes shade or shadow, or as the forest
takes storm or calm, was to remain forever the emblem
of the multitudinous life, as contrasted with that affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
gravity and ossified scholasticism which we so often see&mdash;was
tempted by no familiarity with ancient writing to
any formal rotundity or college-professor mannerism of
diction. His audience is the world, and the numbers
increase as civilization grows&mdash;he moves to-day a broader
stratum of human sympathy than any other man who
ever lived save one&mdash;and this could not have been had
he passed into that narrow chamber called a school.
And yet no four walls of a college could have held him,
for he of all men would have been least apt to prefer
the poor glitter of learned paint to God’s sunlight of living
smiles. When one thinks how much learning has
done to veil genius and impede progress, it is impossible
to suppress a sense of satisfaction at the thought
that the greatest author of all mankind was not learned!
His only teacher was nature, his only need was freedom.
Who gave him this?&mdash;<em>a woman</em>!</p>

<p>“Now do not suppose that I have no sympathy with
colleges, for no man knows their worth better than I;
but it is better to build for eternity than for a Regents’
examination. Another thing you must remember is that
Shakespeare was surrounded by no circle of admirers.
Healthy, whole-hearted, it never occurred to him to ask
what precise position he might occupy in the world of
letters. He did his work for the approbation of one
alone, and she being pleased he was content.</p>

<p>“No jealousy, strife or contention, do you see on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
smooth brow; no hate or fear of unjust rivalry. He
was monarch of one loving, truthful, trusting heart, so
what cared he for popular applause? A prophet has said,
‘Oh, thou foul Circean draught of popular applause, thy
end is madness and the grave!’ This most subtle and
deadly of all poisons was never mingled in the cup of Shakespeare,
and never can be in that of anyone if they work
only for the applause of honest love, that can dissemble
not. To work for popular applause is to court death;
to succeed in winning it, is to be carried to the pinnacle
of the temple and cast upon the stones beneath.</p>

<p>“If a man toil for the good-will of the multitude, there
will come as sure as fate, the time when the egotism of
acquirement will render callous day by day all of his finer
perceptions, kill his delicate sensibilities, destroy his
manhood. No longer will he hold the mirror up to nature;
no longer will the ray of light shine through the
prism, reflecting the beauty of the rainbow&mdash;he is
opaque, dead; and the only sound he gives is ego, <em>Ego</em>,
EGO.</p>

<p>“Need I give illustrations? Look about you on every
hand. Where in all the realm of books is the author
free from this taint! But yes, there are some. This century
has seen a few, but you can count them on the fingers
of one hand. Hero worship is twice cursed. It
bewilders the hero into fantastic error and extravagance,
and the fools who worship accept for a time anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the man whom they have damned sets before them and
proclaim it truth. They extol his eccentricities into
models, his follies into virtues. Thus does hero worship
work double harm.</p>

<p>“What is the cure? Is oblivion the only good? Is
to do, to die? If I achieve must my life go out like
that of certain insects who die in the act of generation?
Wise men ask these questions over and over again. I
give you the answer. It is this&mdash;<em>Together man and woman
were put out of Eden. Only together hand in hand
can they return.</em></p>

<p>“Woman’s love saved Shakespeare. Shakespeare’s
love saved the woman, although the world knows her not
as yet. He never realized his power, and if it had been
told him that his name would go thundering down the
ages, the greatest literary name of all times, he would
have been staggered with incredulity; for if a man ever
realizes or imagines he is at the top, at once his head
grows dizzy. But never fear, the heart of woman can
hold him firm. Duality exists throughout all nature.
A man alone is only half a man&mdash;a woman alone is only
half a woman. The man and woman make the perfect
man. There is the male man and the female man.
Only where these two half spirits work together can
they reach perfection. For every woman there is
somewhere on the earth, or in the spirit realm a mate,
for every man there is his other half; and some time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
this life or in another they will meet, and no priest or
justice of the peace can join what God has not ordained.
But when the right man meets the right woman and
they live rightly, there is an atmosphere formed where no
poisonous draught can enter. These two will say, ‘<em>Between
us there must be honesty and truth for evermore.</em>’
Then each will work for the approbation of the other;
there will be no flattery, for there is honesty; there will
be commendation always when deserved, but no fulsome
praise. Neither will excel the other. Each may be
able to do certain things better than the other, so there
will ever be a friendly rivalry for good. The tendency
to grow egotistical is ever corrected, the poison is constantly
neutralized, for how can you be egotistical when
you only work for the approbation of one who has contributed
to your work as much as you? There is ever
a sharing of every joy, of every exalted thought, of
every acquisition; so the good gained is fused. There
is a perfect commingling. It is not ‘mine,’ nor ‘thine,’
but ‘ours.’ No selfish satisfaction can you take in your
own attainment when by your side stands another as great
as yourself. You are gentle, modest, and you two working
together cannot but recognize a higher power, a greater
than you, a Source you look up to, and ever do you say,
‘Not unto us, not unto us.’ Thus is growth attained
and thus only can perfection be reached.</p>

<p>“Of course I know that some men are not as able as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
some women; and that some men have wives who are
only echoes; and that there are men who in their blindness
desire nothing else&mdash;but a woman who can only
applaud her husband is fixing him in untruth, and they
are each dragging the other down. For we only need
the applause of those who are our equals, otherwise they
will not discern but will applaud simply because we say it.
Then once having tasted blood we resort to sophistry,
trickery and device, knowing we can deceive, to win this
deadly thing our morbid souls do crave.</p>

<p>“Well do I know that as the highest joys of sense
and soul come from love, and sadly do I say it, love misplaced,
diverted, thwarted, causes more misery, heartaches,
sickness, death, than all other causes combined.
The throes of childbirth were sent as punishment for
love wrongly used, and this awful curse can yet be
cured; not in this life perhaps, but it will come, for
God did not design that life should be sacrificed in order
that others still might also have life.”</p>

<p>“The evening following what I have already told, the
young man presented himself at the little red house
where dwelt the Lady Bowenni, and was met at the door
by Harriette, the daughter. Servant and stranger he no
longer was, but friend. The young woman’s cheeks
glowed, her eyes flashed with all the eagerness of restless
purpose.</p>

<p>“Spread out on the table were sundry curiously-bound
books and pamphlets, some written and some in print;
for the nobleman had been a great collector, and had
secured the best wherever literary treasures were to be
found. The young man was cool, composed, and had
not the slightest idea of what the work would be or
where it should begin.</p>

<p>“‘Draw up your chair to yonder table, William, while
I sit on the other side. Now look straight at me (‘I
can’t do otherwise,’ he gravely said), and listen close
while I the story tell which I have got from three old
books&mdash;two of them from Spain were brought, one from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
France. I have dropped and left out this and that, and
put in more, here interpolated, there proclaimed a truth
I once did hear you say. Now let us get the plot all
firmly fixed in our two hearts, and then you it is shall
write; for you do toy with words&mdash;they are your playthings.
You strive not, nor reach out, nor falter, search
or look around, but straightway you do get the thought,
words, gentle words come trooping to you like a thousand
fairies, each in its own order, leading its mate full
gently by the hand. For learned men may work and
strive and sweat and never do they reach the smoothness
you do bring even without a second thought. Careless,
William, you are in manner. You know no rule, yet
I might study a thousand years and could not thus express
the feeling that within me burns; but hinted once
by me to you, straightway you weave the beauteous
thought into a chaplet gay, and then upon my brow you
place it, and seriously you proclaim it mine, when ’tis
not mine, nor thine, but <em>ours</em>.’</p>

<p>“Thus did speak this winsome girl after the story
she had told, and thoughtful sat the man and not a
word he seemed to hear as still she chatted on. When
suddenly he aroused and said:</p>

<p>“‘The pens, my lady! An eagle’s pinion, and this
story you have told shall we give wing! But note you!
three stories have you taken and woven into two instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of one. So shall it stand. Two stories shall we tell,
the one within the other held.’<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>“And straightway were pens and paper brought and
he did write&mdash;steadily and seemingly without thought of
form or rounded sentences, but surely without stop&mdash;and
as the pen went gliding o’er the parchment, and
page on page were turned aside, the fair young girl
did seize and greedily did read, with pen in hand to
make an alteration, although but slight, and her cheeks
did burn and now and then she sighed and raised her
hands. But the young man, he looked not up, but
with calm face and steady hand the work went on;
and as he held the pen in his right hand, his left
hand moved, as though unknown to him, across the
narrow table, and gently did she hold it fast&mdash;and still
the work went on. A few more nights&mdash;the play was
done and to the judges sent. They read aloud. Some
wondered, others sniffed the air, one said: ‘What
rubbish is this sent to us? What folly! and written
by a big peasant boor!&mdash;use it to light the fire. Here,
servant, you, bring on the next so to quickly get this
horrid taste out of our mouths.’</p>

<p>“The young man heard the sentence, smiled softly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and to himself did say, ‘Oh man, proud man, clothed in
a little brief authority, doth cut such fantastic tricks
before high heaven as does make angels weep! Now
for myself I do not care, but the lady forsooth, whose
play it is, or was before ’twas burned&mdash;shame on them!&mdash;how
can I tell her?’ And so he wandered forth and
met but who? Why, Harriette, who sought the youth
full far and wide, for she had heard the news and grieved
she was and sick, fearing the blow might prove too
much for him whose play it was. ‘I care not for myself,’
she said; ‘but how&mdash;how can I tell him?’ They
met&mdash;each read full in the other’s eyes what each would
say. Both smiled and walked away.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII_THOSE_TWO" id="CHAPTER_XVII_THOSE_TWO">CHAPTER XVII.<br /><span class="largefont">THOSE TWO.</span></a></h2>


<p>“The disappointment caused by the harsh rejection
of this first play of William Shakespeare and Harriette
Bowenni was not great. Each had had a more than
speaking acquaintanceship with sorrow, and trouble is only
comparative anyway; so they looked upon the matter
rather as a thing to be expected, an amusing circumstance.
<em>They knew the play was better than the one accepted</em>,
and that was enough. ‘Is not William Shakespeare
just as great as though his name <em>was</em> on the bill
board?’ the lady said. Another reason that made them
look on the matter lightly was that each read their fate
in the other’s face, and as long as no separation is threatened
love not only laughs at locksmiths but at all disaster.
No awkward love-making scene had ever come
between them, no formal declaration. As he wrote that
first night, the young man unconsciously reached out his
hand toward the girl. She took it, and held it lovingly
between her own. When they parted he stooped and
their lips met.</p>

<p>“When next they walked along the street, among
other things he said, ‘I love you, dear.’ The young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
woman made no sign of surprise, but when she wrote to
him the following day (strange how lovers find excuse
to write so often!), there were terms of endearment, all
inserted without apology. No wooing&mdash;no effort at
winning&mdash;no affected coyness. They loved, and true
love need not be ashamed, for ’tis God’s own gift, and
given only to the worthy.</p>

<p>“Each day she wrote a letter to her lover&mdash;each day
he wrote to her. These messages were often in verse,
and part of them are preserved in the sonnets of Shakespeare,
one hundred and fifty-four in number. These
sonnets, it will be noticed, have no special relation one
to the other. Part, it can be seen, are written by a woman
to her lover. Mixed in with these are others written
by a man. You will notice that in those written by
the woman she entreats the young man to marry, and
expresses much regret and surprise that though he loves
her well he will not wed.</p>

<p>“These sonnets were first published in 1609, and were
dedicated&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">“‘<em>To Mr. W. H. Their onlie begetter.</em>’
</p>

<p>“The W stands for William, the H for Harriette. The
prefix of ‘Mr.’ is a mere whimsicality, (a thing all lovers
are guilty of, yet which we are ever ready to forgive),
simply to mystify the world. The first twenty-six of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
these sonnets were written by Harriette during the years
1585 and 1586, before she knew that Shakespeare was
already married; and the perplexity in her ignorance of
the real facts of his life can be imagined.</p>

<p>“Long years after these letters were written, Shakespeare
turned those which were not already in rhyme
into verse for his and her amusement, and now that they
had come to know each other perfectly and the oneness
was complete, many was the laugh they had over their
youthful trials. Anyone who will read the Sonnets,
<cite>Venus and Adonis</cite> and the <cite>Passionate Pilgrim</cite>, and read
them carefully in the light of what I now tell, will get
a clear idea of the first few years’ relations of Shakespeare
and this beautiful and accomplished young woman.
I do not attempt to defend the style or wording of these
poems. They are written in all the hot restless desire of
youth where flesh is not ruled by soul&mdash;where the
earthy is not yet transmuted into the spiritual.</p>

<p>“Said ‘rare Ben Jonson’&mdash;‘I loved the man, and do
reverence his memory on this side of idolatry as much as
any! He was honest and of an open and free nature, had
an excellent fancy, brave notions and excellent expressions,
wherein he flowed with such facility that sometimes
it was necessary he should be stopped. His wit
was in his own power&mdash;would the rule of it had been so
too! but he redeemed his vices with his virtues. There
was in him ever more to be praised than pardoned. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
players have often mentioned it as an honor to Shakespeare
that in his writing whatsoe’er he penned he never
blotted out a line. My answer has been, Would he had
blotted out a thousand.’</p>

<p>“So with Ben Jonson I say, Oh would that these
two had left unwritten a thousand lines!&mdash;but who shall
dictate to genius?</p>

<p>“When Shakespeare left Stratford he attempted to
leave the last year’s dwelling for the new&mdash;to steal the
shining archway through&mdash;close up the idle door. The
past was to him dead. He did not hug it to his heart,
mourn over it, and attempt to kiss it back to life. He
said, ‘The past we cannot recall, the future we cannot
reach, the present only is ours.’ So with no attempt at
concealment, yet with no disclosure of his history, he
said to Harriette Bowenni:</p>

<p>“‘That I do love you, you do know; that I do desire
to wed you, you may guess; and that I cannot is but fact.
Now why should speak I more? You put your arms
about my neck and swear your faith in pretty verse, and
next you contradict this faith by still demanding <em>Why</em>?
No! If I say it is not best, is not that <em>Why</em> enough?’</p>

<p>“In sonnet number twenty the appearance of Shakespeare
is described at this time. A writer says, ‘He
has a lady’s face and scarce a beard.’</p>

<p>“Harriette urged the youth to leave his shabby
lodgings, marry her, and take up his abode with her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
her mother; and in <cite>Venus and Adonis</cite> we hear of the
number of noble lovers that had sought her hand, and
yet she almost on her knees besought William to wed
her. In a spirit of jolly ridicule of this wooing on the
part of Harriette, he wrote the poem of <cite>Venus and
Adonis</cite> and presented it to her. In this poem you will
notice he represents himself as cold and unfeeling, when
the real truth is he was just as full of desire to marry
as she; but the divorce laws of England at that time
were very strict, so much so that only the rich or
influential could secure a divorce at all.</p>

<p>“Shakespeare should have been frank with this girl
and told her his history at once, but he did not do so
until over a year after their first acquaintance. You
can well imagine the surprise of mother and daughter
when he one night said, ‘Come, my history you would
know. Well, I’ll run it through, even from my boyish
days, to the very moment that you bade me tell it,’ and
so he told from childhood to the time he took one last
look at the little village and set his face toward London.
The story being done she gave him for his pains a world
of sighs. She swore in faith ’twas strange, ’twas passing
strange, ’twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful! she wished
she had not heard it. Yet she wished that heaven had
made her such a man. She thanked him, and bade
him if he had a friend that lov’d her, he should teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
him how to tell the story, and that would woo her. On
this hint he spake:</p>

<p>“‘Now you do know full well why I, according to
England’s law, do not you wed&mdash;yet heaven hath decreed
it so. You are my rightful mate; and here and
now, in the sacred presence of her who brought you
forth, I do declare you shall be from now henceforth my
true and only wife.’</p>

<p>“Madame Bowenni was generous, gentle and good, a
woman of most rare and discriminating mind, great and
loving. Years had not soured nor turned to dross the
great and tender heart. She knew for her daughter to
accept William Shakespeare for her husband without
the consent of England’s law, would not be the one
thousandth part the sin as to see her wed a man she
did not love, although good and noble the man might
be. So Shakespeare took up his abode with this fair
lady, and was a faithful and true husband to her, and
she a loving and true wife till death called her hence.</p>

<p>“Harriette Bowenni died in the year 1614, leaving
one child, Shakespeare’s only son. Anne Hathaway had
died some years before, and be it said to his credit
Shakespeare sent her ample funds from time to time,
and that she shared in his prosperity. It is greatly to
be regretted that Harriette died before her lover, otherwise
she would have acted as his literary executor and
collected his writings in proper form. As it is this work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was done by those entirely unfitted for it, and his papers
were brought together from many sources seven years
after his death; and to-day not a single scrap of his
manuscript exists, excepting the letters I possess and the
diary of Harriette Bowenni, in which are various entries
made by Shakespeare. All these letters and the diary
you shall see.</p>

<p>“From his grief at the death of Harriette, Shakespeare
never rallied. He left London, the scene of his mighty
success, and back to his boyhood’s home did he turn,
broken in health and spirit. City men who were once
country boys, always look forward to the coming of old
age, when they can return again to their childhood’s
home. In less than two short years those simple villagers
carried to its last resting-place the worn out body of the
mightiest man of thought the world has ever known.</p>

<p>“When Shakespeare took Harriette Bowenni as his
wife, at once they began their life-work in earnest.
Women then were never recognized in literary work, and
in fact did not ever act upon the stage, their parts being
taken by boys. Harriette knew English history probably
better than any man in England at that time, having
studied it for several years with her father, and written it
out for the nobleman. The first successful plays of
Shakespeare were those of English history. Then followed
tragedy and comedy in rapid and startling succession.
Thirty-seven plays are known positively to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Shakespeare’s, all written in the space of twenty-six
years; there being scarcely any repetition of plot or plan,
all sweeping forward in that matchless and noble diction
possessed by no other writer. The source of nearly all
the plots have been well traced. Many of the plays are
combinations of two or three others. In several instances
the story is taken pure and simple from other
writers, and the dialogue changed, modified, interpolated,
as if it was necessary to get the play out at a certain
time; yet the work is always nobly done, although many
of the plays show very plainly the work of two persons.</p>

<p>“In every one of these thirty-seven plays William
Shakespeare and Harriette Bowenni worked side by side,
she supplying the plot and historical connection and he
the language. The philosophy and by-play was worked
in between them.</p>

<p>“Shakespeare’s conception of womanhood is higher
than that of any other dramatist, even of modern time.
Generally we find the saints and sinners pretty evenly
divided between the sexes. Not so with the Master!
His women are wise, gentle and good. Look at Portia,
Rosalind, Cecelia, Viola, Jessica and others. The character
of Lady Macbeth was worked out by Harriette
alone, as I will show you in her diary where she protests
against William parsing excellencies in the feminine
gender continually, and she asks leave to portray Lady
Macbeth herself alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Each was constantly alert for metaphor, hyperbole,
figure, trope, philosophy or poetical expression. Nothing
escaped&mdash;every thought or fancy to which love could
give birth was woven in. Neither went in society, and
the fact that Shakespeare could not present this woman
as his wife, was rather an advantage than otherwise.
They had no friends but books, and thus were not distracted,
diverted or dragged down by common-place connections,
ignorant or vain people. To be with people
was to lose their relationship to the whole. They were
merely onlookers in Venice&mdash;the world knew them not.
This fully accounts for the total lack of knowledge we
possess of Shakespeare’s life. It has been stated that
Shakespeare belonged to the club to which belonged Sir
Walter Raleigh, Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher, Donne,
Selden and others, that met at the Mermaid Tavern, but
there is no proof at all that he ever attended these
meetings. How such a man lived with such a mind and
still was not known, has astounded humanity; and it is
not to be wondered at that many now doubt that he ever
wrote at all, and very plausibly prove (or think they do),
that this unlettered, untraveled and untutored man <em>could
not</em> (mark the words) have written Shakespeare. It is
not to be wondered at that they cast about for the most
learned man of his time, and pick out Lord Bacon, not
knowing that six Lords Bacon all melted into one
<em>could never</em> (<em>mark my words</em>) equal the work of one great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
man and one great woman, who having put away all
society but each other, cast out all frivolity, set themselves
the task (if task it may be called) solely to assist
that alchemist, the only one who can transmute base
material into good&mdash;<em>Love</em>, undying <em>Love</em>. Love is creative.
It is the one and only source of all creation!”</p>

<p>I had been taking the words of The Man at the rate
of one hundred words a minute. Suddenly they came
faster, faster. I could scarcely keep up. For the first
time I saw The Man had lost his composure. I looked
up. The tears were streaming down his cheeks. He
arose from his seat, paused, raised his hands and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“This woman, Harriette Bowenni; she was my
mother!!”</p>

<p>I began the conversation by a protest against attributing
the success of Shakespeare so entirely to woman’s
influence for “you cannot make a statue out of basswood,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right,” answered The Man, “but
Shakespeare, you must remember, won the love of this
great woman, and thus proved his capacity and ability
to succeed. We succeed by means, that is by the help
of, others. Now take your pencil and paper and write
what I speak&mdash;</p>

<p>“The word success scarcely carries the same meaning
to two people, and I will make no attempt now to a
pedagogic definition of the word, but simply a statement
of facts which will not be disputed by any thinking
person.</p>

<p>“There are certain conditions which we see surrounding
men that are the reverse of success, and on these
we are all agreed. So it might be easier to state what
success is not, than what it is.</p>

<p>“If we see a person whose face is filled with lines of
anxious care, proving to every passerby that the wearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of this look is nervous, apprehensive, restless, fast losing
the capacity for enjoying the good things of life,
we cannot call this person successful, though he is a
millionaire. Yet we find men whom we know are not
worth a hundred dollars, but their faces beam with the
health that comes only from right living. Their entire
bodily attitude tells that they are in line with the harmony
of the universe. They are successful.</p>

<p>“The world is rich beyond the power of man to compute.
We are just beginning to turn the wheels of
commerce with a motive power the vast extent of which
seems limitless, and which we use over and over again
without destroying its substance. The material things
which go to make life comfortable are in extent as
boundless as is the oxygen which makes the combustion
that we call life possible. For do you think for a moment
that the Supreme Intelligence that quickened life
into being would make too much of this and only half
enough of that, so men would have plenty of air to
breathe and plenty of water to drink, but only half
enough food or raiment?</p>

<p>“No, the world is rich&mdash;surpassing rich, but, alas!
men are poor.</p>

<p>“One man gets many things more than he can use and
makes himself poor, that is, unsuccessful, by a vain attempt
to keep that which in fact is not his. He draws
on the material world for more than he needs, but fails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to absorb from the world of spirit of the pure oxygen
of life to aid digestion; he is like a man who has eaten
twice as much as he can digest, he is full of fear and
distrust and his life is a failure. He is not a success.</p>

<p>“And we see men great and good in soul whose bodies
are not properly nourished and who shiver with the
cold. This is not success.</p>

<p>“There is no virtue in poverty. To do without things
we do not need is both manly and right (for to do right
is manly), but to deprive ourselves of the bounties and
blessings that have been provided for us, is not only to
be lacking in common sense, but it is to be guilty of sin.</p>

<p>“So we say that the unsuccessful man is he who does
not secure for his <em>use</em> all that which his being needs for
its growth and advancement.</p>

<p>“I have spoken of the pure air we should breathe
being supplied in limitless quantities, but every physician
knows that the most prolific cause of disease is the
breathing of a bad atmosphere. People deliberately fire
up the coal stove, close the drafts so that the poison
cannot escape up the chimney, shut down the windows
and pray for sweet, refreshing sleep. This is done as
much out in the open country as in the crowded city.
At daylight this morning, just as the summer sun was
coming up from behind the far-away hills, I walked
through the sleeping village and noticed that in almost
every house the windows were tightly shut, blinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
closed, and, of course, the doors locked to keep out burglars,
forgetful that the murderer who sought their lives
was already in the house.</p>

<p>“The rich in cities ride in closed carriages, breathing
the same air over and over. They are pale, yellow and
despondent. The coachman rides outside ruddy and
full of life.</p>

<p>“Thousands upon thousands die yearly of consumption,
a disease coming entirely from improper breathing. If
we use only a part of the lungs, the rest of the cells
collapse, decay and we die&mdash;die through poverty&mdash;die
through not using enough of that which is supplied so
plenteously. And, yet, air is free, but whether through
ignorance or inability (and ignorance is inability) we
die, for nature takes no thought of the individual. You
must comply with her rules or suffer from noncompliance.
‘Here are these good things,’ she says, ‘use
them freely;’ and if we do not know how to use them
we suffer just as surely as though we wilfully rebelled
and knowingly said, ‘We will not use them.’</p>

<p>“So if you ask me to define success, I will say that he
is successful who uses that which his well-being requires
for its best development. To fail is not to use what
your physical, mental and moral well-being demands.
Whether you fail through ignorance of your needs or
inability to supply them makes no difference.</p>

<p>“Thus it might truthfully be said that no life is a complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
success, for no man lays hold on the forces of the
universe and uses to the fullest extent. So there are all
degrees of success. Now I propose to give a few plain
and simple rules for securing to yourself that which
your body and soul demand, and when I speak of one’s
‘Being’ I always mean body and soul&mdash;one no less
than the other, for without soul there would be no body&mdash;body
is here the instrument of soul. And what is
more, I mean <em>worldly success</em>, for the world is but the
sensual manifestation of spirit. You cannot separate
spirit from matter&mdash;matter from intelligence.</p>

<p>“One of the worst mistakes man has made in times
past has been the attempt to separate things into two
parts&mdash;the ‘sacred’ and the ‘worldly.’ All things are
sacred. There is nothing above the natural. There
can be no ‘Super-Natural,’ without we say the supernatural
is natural, which is in fact the truth.</p>

<p>“The wheeling stars, the great sun which warms our
planet into life and light, every manifestation of beauty
which we behold, man himself with his aspirations, his
longings and his unknown possibilities, are <em>natural</em>.
The natural is the all in all.</p>

<p>“We are here for growth, and live on the world. To
achieve a success here, is to achieve a worldly success;
and the highest ambition any man can have is to secure
success, and the only success you can achieve here is a
worldly success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Success is the result of right thinking. ‘As a man
thinketh so is he,’ and what is most encouraging to me
is the thought that a gigantic brain and a mighty grasp
of mind are not at all necessary to success. The secret is
simple, and the wayfaring can comprehend it as well as
the prince. A few plain rules well followed and you
are in the majority, for all nature is on your side and
working in your behalf. What need you of influential
friends? And yet the kind of thinking I am about to
describe will bring the noble and the powerful to your
side. They will seek your acquaintance, they will be
your friends, and it will be their delight to help you,
for it is the way nature assists her children by sending
the love of good people. Night and day your spirit
thinks. Stop thinking now for five minutes and tell me
what you thought. No, you cannot stop. You may not
remember what you thought, when you were in your
sleep, but you thought just the same. But, while you
cannot stop thinking you can direct the thought. You
can control its tendency, and in the course of time (not
long either), you will think only good thoughts&mdash;thoughts
that will insure success to yourself and assist
all those with whom you come in contact.</p>

<p>“Success in every undertaking has come from a right
mental attitude. But your ambition must be worthy
and founded on right or there can be no success. There
can be no such thing as a successful burglar, for the act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
that is wrong brings a reaction that is weakness, defeat,
and disgrace&mdash;the end may be postponed for a day,
but the result is no less sure; while the reaction from
a good act brings to the person an increased self-respect,
a power for good, and this is his reward.</p>

<p>“I will not attempt to give one plan for success in business,
another for success in religious work, and another
set of rules for scholarly attainment. We cannot separate
life into parts, for there can be no success in a
business that is not right, but if your business is honorable
it affords you a most excellent opportunity for
the exercise of spiritual and mental attainment. You
cannot imagine a sincere follower of Truth being engaged
in a bad business, and the personal contact which
a profession or business gives a man with other men
affords him the opportunity to let his light shine.</p>

<p>“The first requisite of success is to know what you
desire. Misty, uncertain hopes and changing wishes
bring uncertain results. The reason we hear so much
of luck and chance in life is on account of the absence
of clear ideals. You must work out in your own mind
what you wish to achieve. Are you a clerk in a big
store, and see yourself in the future always as a clerk,
you will always be one. Suppose, on the other hand,
you see yourself in imagination as the head of the establishment,
and hold this constantly in mind as you
work away in your lowly position day after day. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
very thought is bringing you toward your ideal. You
will have an alertness for business, a desire to please,
and the welfare of the establishment will be constantly
before you. You will always be on time, and when
there is extra work you will remain a little later and
never think of asking if you are to be paid for over
time.</p>

<p>“This cheerful and attentive disposition is sure to bring
you promotion, and even over the heads of older employees.
When a foreman is wanted for the head of a
department you will be the one selected&mdash;no mistake, it
cannot be otherwise. The ideal you hold in your mind
is coming toward you sure. The whirligig of time,
which is ever sifting, assorting, and bringing to the top
the best, is a spiritual law as strong as fate&mdash;in fact, it
is fate&mdash;and you will be the head of this establishment,
and a rich man.</p>

<p>“We do not say that to be the head of a big business
and to be rich are the chief ends for which to work, but
as far as you prize these things, you can only secure them
in the way I have mentioned.</p>

<p>“If you are a country school-teacher, on a small salary,
and never expect to be invited to teach in a higher
school, you never will. But if your ambition is to be
principal in a college, you can attain this position. You
will read the educational journals, and will know all of
the great teachers who now live, and all of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
have gone before. Their names and lives will be familiar
to you. You will dwell in thought on the virtues
of Roger Ascham, and Arnold of Rugby will be your
friend. You will attend the Teachers’ Institutes and
take part, too, and encourage the leader by your sympathy.
You will attract to your side all the good
teachers in the neighborhood, and will soon be in communication
with the chief educators in the country, and
your promotion is sure as sunrise. As soon as you are
made worthy by holding fast to the ideal, you will be
called up higher. But suppose you seek to attain promotion
by connivance and wire-pulling, your defeat is
certain. The thing to do is to be worthy and be ready
to accept the invitation promptly, and it will come.</p>

<p>“The necessity of this clearness of ideal which brings
a calm certainty of manner is more marked perhaps in
the professions of law and healing than elsewhere.</p>

<p>“We are just beginning to appreciate the fact that the
good physician heals more by his presence than his
potions. A physician who believes that man is made
in the image of his Maker and that his body is the
dwelling-place of an immortal spirit, has ever before him
a most lofty ideal. To come within the atmosphere of
such a man, clean in body and pure in heart, is to
absorb to a certain extent his qualities of mind, which
is a powerful force acting on the body for health. He
fills the patient with hope and faith, allays apprehension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
calms the mind of disorder, and allows the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix
natura</i> to act. A doctor of this kind believes in
his power to succeed&mdash;and he does. The lawyer who
fears the other side and is doubtful of his case and who
believes the judge is partial, has already lost his cause.
But if he believes his client is innocent and that the
jury will clear him, if they can be made to see the true
state of affairs, brings judge and jury to this way of
thinking, and receives the verdict he asks for.</p>

<p>“To make people work against you and get the world
in opposition to you, just hold in thought that you are
unfortunate and unlucky and that no one appreciates
you, and then the world is down on you sure enough.
You bring about the thing you fear. But what we
want is men who are positive without being pugnacious;
men who are cheerful but not frivolous. These are the
successful men, and wherever they go they carry help,
health and healing.</p>

<p>“The second requisite of success is that you shall hold
your thought in the positive and not in the negative
mood.</p>

<p>“Be on the lookout for good, and it will come to
you. Avoid negation. Shun controversy. Religious (?)
disputes have hurt the cause of Truth a thousand times
more than all infidels and barbarians, for controversy
stirs up a train of thought and feeling that should never
be aroused, and which brings a reaction in the form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
distrust, jealousy, bickering and hate. The exercise of
such hateful emotions disturbs the poise of your mind
and invites failure. If a man voices wrong thoughts in
your presence, do not be so vain as to imagine you can
set him straight by argument. Conversions are not
made in that way. You need not lend your assent
to his wrong statements, but your silence will be a
powerful force acting on him and will tend to make him
doubt his infallibility, will set him to thinking seriously
and may bring him back into the line of Truth. If
you had argued with him, the chances are that his
efforts to refute you would have sunk him deeper into
his error, for while you were talking to him he would
have been thinking up an argument to overthrow
your efforts to put him right, and failure to do so would
have reacted on you and made you hot and impatient.</p>

<p>“Again I say, a positive and not a negative attitude are
necessary to success. Parents and teachers say to children,
‘don’t, don’t, don’t,’ thus sending to them and
putting them in a negative element. Their powers are
not directed by this ‘don’t’ to secure what they need.
They drift rapidly, aimlessly from one worthless, mischievous
waste of power to another. Let the parent
and teacher say ‘<em>do</em>,’ direct this force, open a way for
its use. You cannot gain force, power, by refraining
from doing. Power is gained by doing, and gained only
by doing. What is the great difference between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
spirit of the Old and New Testaments? The Old Testament
is full of ‘Thou shalt nots,’ while the New is full of
positive force. Contrast Leviticus with the Sermon on
the Mount, the Ten Commandments with ‘Come unto
me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and I will
give you rest.’</p>

<p>“Positive moods come to all in greater or less extent.
If we court them, entertain them, they remain long with
us. They only go when we send them from us. If we
keep a silent demand for them they will return to us
and the visit be longer than before. Put ourselves in
the right attitude and they will cease to be visitors, but
will take up their permanent abode with us, the mood
will then here become a state.</p>

<p>“In such state success is inevitable. Each person may
have success, should have it. Should be satisfied with
nothing less than success. We have each felt moments
of success, the exultation and life coming from it. We
must have this as our state of mind, continual success,
permanent success. Success, not necessarily, as the
world understands it. Success does not need to be
defined; each one knows it, none can be deceived about
it. Success brings peace and rest and that highest state
of happiness we can know here on earth&mdash;a foretaste of
Heaven. This does not come by striving nor trying,
‘Not by might nor by power but by my spirit, saith the
Lord.’ It comes by holding ourselves in a receptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
attitude, ‘Hoping all things, believing all things.’
Looking not back, but forward, living to-day. There
must be definite, high, pure purpose.</p>

<p>“The positive state is the state of hope and hope is an
attribute of God Himself. Nothing in the material or
spirit world can withstand the force of this positive
state. It is in accordance with the laws of the universe,
and all the forces of the universe work with and for us
when we are in harmony with nature. We are then
one with the Infinite and all things are ours.</p>

<p>“To recapitulate we will say&mdash;you must see in your
own mind definitely what you wish to become. Hold in
your imagination the clear, strong, hopeful ideal.</p>

<p>“Avoid gloomy, despondent, negative people. If the
weather is unpleasant, don’t make it your continual
theme of conversation. If you have unpleasant bodily
sensations or symptoms do not tell people of them.
This will cause you to be shunned by those whose help
you need, and you draw to yourself a sickly, weakly
and uncertain thought element.</p>

<p>“Cultivate the positive state. Take the good wherever
you find it, and let the bad go, it will die through lack
of attention.”</p>

<p>The next Saturday was rainy the entire day, so I
took the 5:30 train to Jamison, which it will be remembered
is a small country village. The usual country
loafers were about the depot, the coming of the trains
being matter of such importance to some of the residents
of these out-of-the-way places.</p>

<p>“There she is,” one said to another.</p>

<p>I saw I was an object of some attention, but merely
thought it the usual curiosity the advent of a stranger
excites in a small place. I walked across through the
fields to the cabin, and found The Man waiting supper
for me. The neat pine table was covered with a clean
linen spread, and it must be stated that The Man was a
good cook as well as a good housekeeper. I mentioned
these things. He smiled and replied:</p>

<p>“Fortunately I have not much furniture to care for,
and eating but two meals a day, and those not very
sumptuous, your remarks are not so very flattering after
all.”</p>

<p>“Now,” I said, when we were seated at the table, “I
want to ask you a question. That awful night I first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
came you spoke of your wife. Then you paused, and
said you had no woman’s clothing in the house. I suppose
your wife is away. Will she be here soon?”</p>

<p>“Friend,” was the answer, “she is here now in spirit,
but for the present her body is in England. She is doing
a similar work there to what I am doing here. It
will be a year before I will again enfold her in these
arms, and yet I ever feel her presence. We commune
by thought transference. She speaks to me often; not
in words of course, for as we do not think in words so
in the spirit realm language, so-called, is useless. It is
not necessary for you to spell the thought out to comprehend
it&mdash;it comes over you like an impulse. In fact,
all thought of spirit, whether the spirit be in body or
not, causes a vibration on the ether which the dull souls
of most mortals are unable to comprehend: just as a
man in a drunken stupor requires a kick or a push to
make him open his eyes.</p>

<p>“I told you it was through love of this woman, my
wife, that my spiritual eyes were opened; and without
her aid never could I have arrived at knowledge. I was
forty years of age when I found her in this life, and
hand in hand we walked, and together we ate of the
tree of knowledge.</p>

<p>“In the old fable you remember the man and woman
were told not to eat unworthily. Some accounts are
imperfectly related, so as to include a prohibition, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
this is distortion made by priests in the Sixth Century,
of the real truth. To eat unworthily is to die, and you
must remember that this story is true; but under right
conditions the right man searching for truth, walking
hand in hand with the right woman (and there is one
right woman for every man, and one man for every
woman) can attain perfection&mdash;that is, completeness.</p>

<p>“I told you something of atmosphere, and you must
write this down as one of the greatest living truths, that
the male and female elements are required to form a
perfect spiritual atmosphere.</p>

<p>“This accounts for the slow progress the world has
made. Men have lived alone in thought and excluded
women from their councils, thus depriving themselves
of the spiritual female element wherein is contained the
germ of all truth. The true sex is spiritual, not physical.
Sex only symbolizes the great truths which lie
behind. When you imagine men rushing to the sacrament
of the Lord’s Supper, and stuffing themselves with
the bread which represents the body of our Savior, and
reeling with drunken and maudlin hilarity from the
effects of the wine which represents His blood, you see
an exact picture of what has been done for thousands of
years in this holy matter of sex. Friend, do you wonder
that Adam and Eve were turned out of the garden,
and that they were ashamed when in the presence of each
other?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“To give you a slight glimpse of what a man and
woman can do working together in a mental and spiritual
way, I will explain that for many years every day
my wife wrote me a letter of from one to a dozen pages
just as the spirit moved her. She wrote without special
thought as to form or matter, with no foolish fear that
she would repeat herself or say an inconsistent thing.
She simply thought aloud, and wrote it out for no eye
but that ‘of her own true lover.’ As she is a woman
of lofty aspirations, with heart filled with love and a
desire for righteousness, the general tenor of those letters
you may guess, although you could not as yet fully
appreciate the great and exalted thought. Every morning
on my table (for we each had a room of our own), I
found my letter, and fervently I daily pressed the message
to my lips and softly broke the seal, read the letter
through once, sometimes twice to get its full import;
and if I did not seem to grasp it then, I laid it by until
the following day. But generally at once, my soul saturated
with joy&mdash;for you must never forget that the
highest joys are those of thought&mdash;I took my pen, went
carefully over the letter, marked out a word here and
there, inserted another. By arrangement my wife wrote
only on every other line, and sometimes skipped several,
leaving a blank space to be filled up by me, as a hint
that I should carry the thought further and give a completeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to that which she had begun, or to answer a
question.</p>

<p>“There is only one source of knowledge&mdash;all other is
second hand. At the first the truth was whispered to
some man (when I say man of course I include woman,
as the term always should) direct. This we call inspiration.
Moses went up into the mountain&mdash;as all men
must to receive truth; that is, they must withdraw for
a season from the distractions, ambitions and diluting
influences of lower thought currents&mdash;and there the
tables of stone were delivered to him. A beautiful allegory&mdash;and
true! Jesus went up into the mountain
alone, and also with the disciples. You and I now are
on the Mount of Transfiguration, and you will never be
the same woman who made the ascent, but one transfigured&mdash;that
is, changed&mdash;greater and better.</p>

<p>“That which was pure inspiration in her letters&mdash;and
inspiration comes only when you work for love and
not for hire, and for the approbation of one&mdash;I marked
in parenthesis with red ink, meaning by this that it
should be copied by her into a book which we called
‘Our Book.’ This book was not for publication, but for
no eyes but our own. The thoughts therein recorded
were neither hers nor mine, but ours; for I had corrected
her thought or carried it further, and as she did
the final copying, the form of the thought was changed
often from its original intent. Thus neither of us could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
pick from this book our own thoughts, such was the
perfect commingling. The great advantage at that time
of writing out in language was that it gave precision and
material form to that which was purely spiritual; serving
as basis for a better comprehension of what at
that time might in the hurry and strife of worldly affairs
have eluded our grasp&mdash;‘Thoughts that broke
through fancy and escaped,’ as the prophet has spoken.</p>

<p>“You must remember that each bud flowers but once,
and each flower has its own minute of perfect beauty;
so in the garden of the soul, each feeling has its flowering
instant in which it bursts forth into radiance. Now
I live amid a continual blossoming of roses, and no
longer do I endeavor to imprison them in words. The
exquisite joys of personal relationship with the loved
one were then ours, as they are now, for nothing good
ever grows stale or unprofitable unless misused. In
those days there was a slight impatience to grasp these
exquisite joys of thought and feeling, and this impulse
you see pictured in our writing out the thought in words;
but now we have come to a full comprehension of the
fact that we are living in eternity, not time, and there
need be, must not be haste.</p>

<p>“So we now live apart or together, which ever seemeth
best; and when we meet it is as a bridal morning&mdash;in
fact, life to us is a wedding journey, for Heaven is
ours. We each are self-reliant, as you see it is not necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
for us to live together continually, and yet we
each depend on the other. If accident should destroy
her body or mine, the spirit of the other would also withdraw
and new bodies would be formed; and of course
we would ever be together, for like attracts like.</p>

<p>“Thus you see how, walking hand in hand, heart to
heart, each working for the approbation of the other,
all with perfect faith and trust, though one sinned the
other was only waiting to forgive; a continual friendly
strife as to who should breathe the finer atmosphere, have
the nobler aim, the purer thought; that the bad died from
inanition, the unworthy ceased to be simply through lack
of exercise, and only the good remained and its continual
use gave constantly increased power and strength; each
criticising, which implies both approbation and censure.
Never arguing or belittling ourselves and the theme by
controversy, always full of hope, good cheer and love&mdash;which,
remember, encompasses in itself all the virtues&mdash;you
can comprehend how life was a continual courtship;
and as fast as we were able to understand truth, it came to
us clear, limpid, transparent. Things which once seemed
opaque, dense, complex, now were clear as noonday.
Gradually the fog lifted, we breathed the pure ozone
of life. Faith in each brought faith in God; so that
‘He doeth all things well,’ was not said alone in words,
but it became a part of our lives. We studied truth&mdash;we
lived truth, we became truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do not imagine that our interchange of thought
was limited to cold written correspondence, for at times
we romped through the garden and groves adjoining
our dwelling like two children. Strife and reaching
out, yearning for knowledge were put aside. We endeavored
to live in a soul-house, clear as glass, in which
the ray of light coming from the great Source of all life
and light could freely penetrate to its inmost corner. We
were ever alert for the coming gleam, and ever in
these play spells, which came daily, we saw the ever-rising
sun of truth.</p>

<p>“Why I have told you so distinctly about the daily
writing of our best thoughts, is because there is ever
a border-land between truth and error, where dwell
mysticism, which is miasma to the soul. Some talk
mysticism and thus move in a circle; but by writing
out and subjecting the thought afterward to the keen
analysis of the masculine and feminine mind, any error
is detected.</p>

<p>“Friend, it may seem strange to you, but there was
once a time years ago when I doubted the truth of the
Bible; but I was brought by my loved one out of the
darkness into the light. Slowly but surely the mist lifted
and the sun came out brighter and brighter, and whereas
I was once blind I now see. Never doubt it, friend,
but tell it to the far off corners of the earth&mdash;write it in
your heart in letters of gold, that men may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> see <em>the
Bible is true</em>. The life of my loved one, and my life
which is hers, has proved it. For love is life, and in this
love of man for woman God has pictured the true fruition&mdash;which
is perfect knowledge. For is it not plain
that he who truly loves cannot prove inconstant? and
where the woman truly loves she is bound by the law
of God to constancy. They cannot fall as long as love
is held inviolate; and once loving, love cannot be violated.</p>

<p>“But it is growing late and you had better climb up the
ladder and go to bed. Though to-morrow is the day of
rest, we will stroll through the woods; and by the way,
I have a great and important truth to tell you. You
need not write it, but I will talk as we stroll; the nature
of what I will tell is so peculiar you will remember it
all and can write it out at home. You are making progress
I see. You can undress in the moonlight, and I will
place my cot out beneath the trees and sleep. I delight to
rest out under the open sky, while the stars keep vigil,
some disappearing from sight and others coming up over
the horizon to take their places. How quietly they
come! How simple yet ever wonderful are the works
of God! And so it is that man will come to perfection,
for does it not say ‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for
they shall see God’?”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX_THE_ARREST" id="CHAPTER_XX_THE_ARREST">CHAPTER XX.<br /><span class="largefont">THE ARREST.</span></a></h2>


<p>I climbed the ladder and looked out of the open window
on the great, serene and silent scene spread out before
me. Great gulfs of shadows lay under the trees, a
gentle breeze stirred the branches, and their upturned
leaves glimmered silvery in the moonlight which covered
the sleeping earth as with a garment.</p>

<p>I undressed and knelt beside the little bed and prayed
my first prayer.</p>

<p>Thirty-seven years had slipped past me&mdash;my wavy-brown
hair was already sprinkled with white; lines of
care were on my face; girlhood gone; the marks of age
had come; I was reaching out toward two score, and I
had never prayed. Of course I had read the prayer-book,
and in church I had mumbled certain words; but
now for the first time I fell on my knees and buried my face
in my hands. The hot tears came quick and fast, and
trickled through my fingers; but they were tears of joy,
not sorrow. At last life seemed to show a gleam of
meaning! There was purpose in it all, God’s purpose!
I prayed that I might do His will. The only words
that came to my sobbing throat, and these I said over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and over again, were: “Oh, give me a clean heart and a
right spirit!”</p>

<p>I got into bed, which never before seemed so welcome.
I seemed to relax every muscle and abandon myself to
rest. I heard the far-away hooting of a whippoorwill&mdash;the
gentle murmur of the winds as they sighed through
the branches seemed to sing me a sweet lullaby. I imagined
I was again a child; so sweet and perfect was the
rest; and I remembered the gentle baritone voice of The
Man as he had said, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for
they shall see God. Blessed&mdash;&mdash;” I was asleep.</p>

<p>It seemed as if I had not slept ten minutes, but I
found afterward five hours had passed, when I was
startled by a wild yelling, and a coarse, grating, brutal
voice that shouted:</p>

<p>“Now we have got ’em&mdash;pound in the door!”</p>

<p>Bang&mdash;crash it went, and the tramping of a score of
feet I heard below. I jumped from bed, and without a
thought as to what I would do grabbed the end of the
ladder, and in a twinkling it was on the floor under my
feet.</p>

<p>“There, boys, didn’t I tell you? They’re up-stairs.
There, Bill, why in hell didn’t you ketch that ladder
afore they pulled it up, or else go up it?”</p>

<p>“What, you think that I’d go up that ladder alone and
fight the two of ’em? Not much! Why, the man alone is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a terror&mdash;and the woman, God help us! she’d scratch
my eyes out afore the rest and you could come up.”</p>

<p>“Hey, you, up thar, you old reprobate, we are on to
you, don’t yer see? Now come down peaceable or it’ll
go hard with you.”</p>

<p>They waited for an answer, but not a word did I say.
I hastily had put on my dress, and stood with a little
hickory-bottomed chair in my hands near the opening in
the floor through which I had pulled the ladder.</p>

<p>“Hain’t you goin’ to answer? Well, all right, don’t
then! We’ll jist make a bonfire on this yer floor and
see if it singes yer manes.”</p>

<p>Some one of the rabble outside here fired a revolver
several times, but I rightly guessed this was only to
frighten. I still stood firm. Perhaps I was frightened,
but if so it did not affect my strength, for I was waiting
for a head to appear at the opening, and I did not have
to wait long, for soon there was a whispered consultation
below. I heard a hoarse whisper say, “No, you
go”&mdash;“Well then, Jake, you try it,”&mdash;“Hell, who’s
afraid! Here, you, give me a lift,” and a hand grasped
the edge of the floor.</p>

<p>I stepped back, gripped the chair and swung it aloft,
and through the floor by the glare of the torches I saw
the face of Bilkson, the junior. That chair was well
on its errand before I caught sight of the countenance;
but no matter, I would not have stayed it if I could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Crash&mdash;down went the man. I heard him fall like
a dead weight, just as I have seen a bale of hay tumbled
out of a barn door.</p>

<p>“I’m shot! I’m shot! Run for a doctor, boys. I’m
dying! A minister. Oh, Judas! I’m shot through the
brain,” I heard him scream.</p>

<p>“Shet up, ye dam fool! Yer haven’t any brains to
shoot. Nobody’s shot. They hit you wid a club&mdash;’ats
all. Yer haven’t been hurt. Yes, by George! yer
smeller is broken, and yer had better spit out them teeth
afore yer swallers ’em. Gawd help him, boys, I’se glad
it ain’t me. He’s got a bad swipe. Well, it’s his bizness
anyway, not ours. We jest come ter see the funf
an’ lend a hand if we was needed.”</p>

<p>Here I heard a voice coming from a little distance.
“We got him! We got him!” There was a sudden
stampede below for the outside, and looking out of the
window I saw by the glare of the torches (the moon had
gone down and it was now quite dark), five or six of the
ruffians holding The Man. He offered no resistance, but
two had seized either arm, and two had hold of his collar
from behind, and they were leading him toward the
house.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him! We’ve got him!” they shouted.
“Now wasn’t he sharp? Heard us a-coming, got out
of the window, and carried the cot down under a tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and pretended to be asleep. Oh yer can’t fool us, old
man&mdash;we’re on to you.”</p>

<p>“Why, Bilkson, you said he wore false whiskers and a
wig&mdash;look here!” and the young wretch gave a savage
pull at the snowy beard, and a man behind grabbed into
his hair with a jerk that nearly threw The Man off
from his feet.</p>

<p>“Now wot’s the use of yankin’ of him around so?”
said a tall young fellow. “Look at that shoulder, will
you. He kin lick any one of you if you give him a
show, and as long as he is decent and ain’t tryin’ to get
away, let up on him, will you now! I’ll vouch for
him.”</p>

<p>At this they loosened their hold, but stood around;
some with clubs, several carried pitchforks, and two had
revolvers which they brandished and now and then fired
in the air. All the while the yelling and running talk
filled the air, oaths and obscene jokes were bandied
about, and I saw that several carried bottles which were
freely passed around.</p>

<p>They stood outside for a minute, all asking questions
of The Man. “Who are you and where did you come
from? Enticin’ foolish women out here, that is fine bizness,
ain’t it? We’ll show you!” and I saw a fist held
up close to that fine face.</p>

<p>One fellow took off his slouch hat and struck The
Man with it, at the same time saying: “See, I’m the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
only one in the gang what respects you.” At this sally
there was a big laugh. “He says he is a son of God.
You heard him say that, Jake, up at the store?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jake, “he said not only he was a son of
God but we all is. Where is the gal&mdash;she hasn’t got
away? The city gent says she is up-stairs fixen her
toilet so as to come down and receive the callers.”</p>

<p>“Go up again, Bilkson, and tell her I’m dead gone on
her.”</p>

<p>The handkerchiefs tied around the face of the junior
smothered the reply, and still the rabble yelled and
talked. Through a crack between the logs I saw a bottle
passed to the tall young fellow I have spoken of, and
I saw him take it and fling it far into the bushes, as he
said in a commanding voice: “Here, you fellers, I’ve
seen enough of this. We came out here with these
two city gents to arrest the man and gal. Now, what
the devil are you doing, just standing around getting
drunk and yellin’ like fools?&mdash;You, old man, they’ve
got you and air going to take you to Buffalo, and the gal
too, wherever she is. There’s another city chap out in
the bush. Now go ’long peaceable-like both of you,
and I’ll knock the senses out of any man what lays a
hand to you. I will, or my name ain’t Sam Scott.”</p>

<p>Up to this time The Man had not spoken, and I could
not detect from the flare of the torches that the calm
had left his beautiful face. As a lamb, dumb before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
shearer, so opened he not his mouth. He turned and
looked at Sam Scott and said, quietly,</p>

<p>“Friend, we will go with you.” Then in a louder
voice, which I knew was for me, “Do not fear&mdash;no harm
can come to you. We will go.” I hesitated not a moment,
but lowered the ladder, and in an instant I stood
among the rabble as they crowded about me, with faces
full of wicked curiosity, brutality and hate.</p>

<p>“Oh, you didn’t know we was here or you wouldn’t
have kep’ us waitin’, would you?”&mdash;“Now, ain’t she a
slick un!&mdash;and in her bare feet too. Well, the walk through
the grass will be good fer her corns.”&mdash;“Say, now less
get her drunk. She’ll be awful funny when she’s full,”
and they passed up a whisky-bottle toward me; and so
the remarks flew as the crowd of thirty or more men
kept pushing closer around, anxious to get a nearer view
of me.</p>

<p>“I say, miss, is that the latest style of wearing hair
on Canal street?”&mdash;“Oh, you forgot your bustle!”&mdash;“You
don’t feel as big as you generally do!”&mdash;“You
won’t snub us now, will you, even if we do live at the
Cross-roads?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam Scott took me by the arm. “Don’t be afraid,
missis&mdash;I know them all. Let us go,” he said.</p>

<p>I looked into the face of this tall young man, and saw
the look of quiet determination as we moved out of the
door. There are two kinds of composure&mdash;one which
speaks of calm rest and peace, the other a calm that is
so quiet it threatens. It is the hush we feel before the
storm&mdash;the composure of the couchant leopard before he
springs. This was the look on the face of this twenty
years old stripling as he pushed me not ungently before
him and motioned that The Man should walk by my side.</p>

<p>Bilkson led the way, his head tied up so he could not
wear his hat. Doubtless he exaggerated the severity of
his wounds, hoping to get sympathy from the crowd.
But be it known this was not a sympathetic assemblage.
Scott seemed the only sober man among them,
and they kept still crowding near, and still the ribald
jeering continued. Scott walked close behind me, and I
noticed that he was the only one who carried no weapon&mdash;even
Bilkson, who walked like a drum major at the
head of the procession, carried on his shoulder a fencerail.</p>

<p>“The band will now play the wedding-march,” shouted
a loud mouthed buffoon. “They took their wedding
tower afore the ceremony, didn’t they?” And still the
awful obscenity which I dare not think of, still less
write, continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>One man, no longer young but drunker than the rest,
big, red whiskered and burly, reeled up by my side and
endeavored to put his arm around me. “Only one kiss,
my dear&mdash;just one. Now don’t be frisky,” he hiccoughed.</p>

<p>I felt the nauseous hot whisky breath against my
cheek. A suppressed scream came from my lips and I
started back. Suddenly I saw the right arm of Scott
shoot forward. I saw the ruffian dodge and thought
Scott had struck at him and missed his mark; but
quicker than the flash of thought the tall young man
grew a foot taller, the head went back, the chest heaved,
the lungs filled, his body seemed to sway to the left and
pitch forward, the brawny left fist shot out like a thunderbolt
and caught the ruffian square on the angle of the
jaw. The man seemed to spring into the air, and as he
fell in a heap ten feet away I saw blood gush from his
eyes, nose and mouth. The first right hand move of
Scott was merely a feint. As the man dodged to the
left he ran square against that terrific stroke, which was
not a mere hit with the clenched hand, but a stroke
backed up by the entire weight of the body. In dodging
the blow he had rushed to meet it.</p>

<p>As we passed on, scarcely pausing during the incident
I have described, I heard a coarse voice behind say,
“He is dead! He got that awful left hander! He’s
done for sure! What will his wife say to this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Some fell back to look after the man who was hurt and
others dropped off or fell behind one by one. I looked
in the east and saw the great red streaks which told of
the coming of the day. The stars disappeared. I heard
the merry song of birds (how the birds do sing early in
the morning!) and when we reached the village the sun
was just peering over the far off hills. Bilkson, still
with his fence rail, marched ahead. The Man and I
walked hand in hand, for my woman’s nature had began
to assert itself; although at first I felt strong and able to
endure anything, but as we entered the village my hand
went out to The Man and I felt his reassuring grasp.</p>

<p>This was the first time my hand had touched his, and
the only time he had come near me since the first night
I saw him, when he passed his hand over my face as I
went to sleep.</p>

<p>The mob had disappeared, but a quarter or an eighth
of a mile back, I saw coming, jauntily swinging a cane,
a high white hat on the back of his head, the Prince
Albert coat buttoned around his pompous form, Mr.
Pygmalion Woodbur, attorney and counsellor at law.
Close behind me still followed Sam Scott, dark and determined.</p>

<p>We entered the little tumbledown depot, and The
Man and I sat down on one of the hard benches, Sam
Scott seated scowlingly between us. Bilkson and the
fencerail thought best to remain outside. Mr. Woodbur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
entered and smilingly bid me “Good-morning,”
stroked the high hat and hoped I was well. He said he
heard that I was in trouble; that I had been indiscreet;
and knowing my little lapses from the path of rectitude
were merely sins of the head and not of the heart, he
at once decided to befriend me, and had come out from
the city to see that I received right treatment. There I
sat, hatless and shoeless, but not friendless, for ever did
I feel the serene composure of The Man, and spread out
over his bony knee I saw the great brown hand of Sam
Scott.</p>

<p>The train was two hours late, and as we sat in the
depot children came, curiously peering in the door to
see the bad man and woman whom the officers from the
city were obliged to arrest. Women came carrying
babies in their arms, and rough-whiskered but kindly-hearted men stared at us, and carried on
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto voce</i> conversations
which I could partially hear.</p>

<p>“Now ain’t she a wicked-looking thing?” said a
woman. “See her long hair clear to her waist&mdash;and
how brazen!” said another. “Why, if it was me I
would cry my eyes out for very shame, and there she
sits pale like and not a bit scared.”&mdash;“Ah, you Sam
Scott, where did you get the introduction?”</p>

<p>Sam Scott sent back a look for an answer, and the
questioner sneaked away.</p>

<p>I shook with the cold morning air, for I brought no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
wrap. One woman, who carried a baby dressed only in
its nightgown, stared at me, and I saw her hastily throw
her apron over her head and go out, running against the
door as she turned. Soon she came back. I noticed
her eyes were very red. She brought me an old pieced
bed-quilt, and told me to put it around me to keep me
warm; to take it with me, and if I didn’t have a chance
to send it back I needn’t; and abruptly as she came she
rushed away.</p>

<p>The train arrived and we entered the smoking-car,
leaving Sam Scott on the platform. I looked at him
and endeavored to speak, but the words stuck in my
throat. He guessed what I wanted to say, and stammered,</p>

<p>“Now, you, missis, keep still will you. I know, don’t
I&mdash;how that blamed sun does hurt my eyes!” and he
began gouging one eye with the knobby knuckles.</p>

<p>Arriving in Buffalo, I saw drawn up in the depot
yard a patrol-wagon, with three brass-buttoned officers
seated therein. I knew they were waiting for us, and
that Bilkson had telegraphed for them, possibly to deepen
my humiliation. As we descended from the car, Bilkson
called out in the direction of the officers,</p>

<p>“Here they are, and you’d better look out for ’em!
Just look at me all chawed up. An awful fight we
had!” And surely he looked as if he spoke the truth,
for a half dozen dirty men had contributed a dirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
handkerchief apiece to tie up his broken head. “Take
no chances, or you must run your own risks,” he continued.</p>

<p>At this one of the officers went back to the patrol-wagon
and returned with handcuffs.</p>

<p>“Here, old gal,” he said, “we’re used to sech as you&mdash;the
worse you are the better we like you! Spit and
kick and scratch now all you want, but put on the
jewelry just for looks, as it is Sunday morning, you
know.”</p>

<p>I felt the cold steel close with a snap around my
wrists, we were pushed into the wagon, Bilkson climbed
on the seat with the driver, and amid a general yell
from a party of street gamins we dashed up Exchange
street. The bells were ringing, calling worshipers to
church. Children dressed out in stiff white dresses,
women daintily attired, family groups, we passed on
their way to church, and they turned to look with wondering
eyes.</p>

<p>At Michigan street I saw coming toward us a form I
knew full well, the first and only face which I had seen&mdash;it
seemed for years&mdash;which I might truly call friend.
It was Martha Heath, walking briskly forward, going I
knew to a mission Sunday-school on Perry street, where
she taught a class of grinning youngsters. She, too,
looked at the patrol-wagon with its motley load, and I
saw she did not recognize me. I thought of calling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
her, but the restraining influence of the officer’s club,
who sat close to me, froze the words on my lips. Still
she looked. I held up my hands showing the handcuffs
in mute appeal. I saw the books drop from her grasp.
Her hand went to her head in dazed manner&mdash;she reeled&mdash;staggered&mdash;and
grasped a friendly railing as we whirled
by.</p>

<p>The driver cracked his whip in the direction of a passing
policeman, and pointed over his shoulder with his
thumb, and they both laughed.</p>

<p>“What charge?” the officer asked, as we were
marched up before the high desk at the station-house.</p>

<p>“Make the entry in lead pencil and call it burglary&mdash;we
may want to change it later. Oh, we’ve got it in
for ’em though! Put ’em in the freezer, and mind no
one sees ’em, for we want to make ’em confess,” said
Woodbur, lowering his voice to a confidential whisper.</p>

<p>The next morning in the <cite>Daily Times</cite> was the following
item, and the clipping now adorns my scrap book.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center largefont">BEAUTY’S BLOWOUT.</p>

<p class="center xlargefont">A FREE RIDE.</p>

<p class="center">HOW ASPASIA HOBBS HOBNOBS WITH CAPTAIN KILBUCK AT NO. 10.</p>

<p>Church goers yesterday morning in the vicinity of Main
and Exchange streets were treated to the shocking sight of
seeing one of Buffalo’s former society belles taking a ride
with the genial Jimmy Smith, who received first prize in the
recent Times contest as the most popular policeman in Buffalo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Old residents well remember Hobbs, of Hobbs, Nobbs
&amp; Porcine, who skipped by the light of the moon to Canada,
and the fair virgin in the patrol-wagon was none other than
Aspasia Hobbs, daughter of the above. Now who says there
is nothing in heredity? Aspasia was attired in her bare feet
and a blue quilt which the officers provided for her for decency’s
sake, and looked as if she had been having a high
old time with the elderly hayseed seated in the wagon with
her.</p>

<p>Well, the good book is right when it says, “There is no fool
like an old fool.” Verily, when a woman falls she goes to
depths to which a man can not descend. The festive Hobbs
has been going it strong lately and as there are quite a number
of charges against her, doubtless Judge Prince will do
his duty. By the way, we hear the worthy judge has decided
to accept the nomination for another term.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII_BY_THE_WAY" id="CHAPTER_XXII_BY_THE_WAY">CHAPTER XXII.<br /><span class="largefont">BY THE WAY.</span></a></h2>


<p>Reader, pray do not be a fool and say this story is
fiction. Would that part of it was! But the treatment
I received by the mob on that terrible night is the most
natural and easiest thing in the world under the present
conditions of society. It may happen to you, and worse,
anytime, in any town, village or city, from Boston to
Texas&mdash;for humanity is the same wherever you go.</p>

<p>Woodbur and Bilkson arrived at the village of Jamison
at eight o’clock on that Saturday evening. They called
on the shoemaker, who was a justice of the peace,
showed him their warrants for the arrest of “John Doe”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and “Mary Roe,” supposed to be secreted in a log house
in a certain woods two miles away. They desired to surround
the house at three o’clock in the morning and
capture the inmates, who were said to be desperate characters.</p>

<p>The shoemaker J. P. put on his specs, read the warrant
with a great show of wisdom, said of course he
would help make the capture, and so would his son
Tom.</p>

<p>Tom was called in, told the circumstances, and requested
to engage the services of two or three trusty men
to go along. “But, Tom, mind you keep the matter
quiet,” wound up the shoemaker.</p>

<p>So Tom promised, and of course told confidentially
every one he saw that the “cranky old man and stuck up
woman” they had seen, who lived in Smith’s log house up
in the clearing, were escaped murderers, and that all who
wanted to help make the capture must be at the tavern
at three o’clock Sunday morning. Now excitement is a
scarce article in country towns, and mankind is ever
greedy for it; so at three o’clock the select male
population of Jamison was at the tavern&mdash;mind you not
bad people either, just good, plain, homely, honest citizens.
Most of them would have been terribly insulted
if you had hinted that they were not Christians.</p>

<p>I told you only one man out of fifty thinks, that the
rest have no opinions but those furnished by parents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
preachers and sophistical politicians. I do not say these
opinions are error necessarily, but that they are simply
borrowed. Having received this second-hand opinion,
they will dig over the whole earth for reasons and excuses
to defend it, honestly thinking the while they are
in search of truth&mdash;mere followers of a bell-wether.</p>

<p>Bilkson just at this time was the aforesaid bell-wether.
Someone said this man and woman were criminals
(there is the opinion); therefore they must be&mdash;in
fact, there was no proof to the contrary. Then they
began to back up the opinion which had been so skilfully
injected into them. They remembered certain
blasphemous remarks of the man, for had he not said,
“I am the son of God, and all men may be if they
claim their heritage,”&mdash;“I have divine rights by reason
of heavenly parentage,”&mdash;“A church is no more sacred
than a blacksmith shop,”&mdash;“Sunday is no more holy than
any other day, and a preacher’s calling no more sacred
than a farmer’s,”&mdash;“No man by dying can wipe out the
sins of others, but every man is a savior of his race who
lashes himself to the mast of righteousness” etc.?</p>

<p>“Just as if there is any sense,” said the blacksmith,
“in lashing one’s self to the mast except to save one’s
self! He is a Catholic, too, for didn’t he say he not only
worshiped Jesus but also His mother?” And another
declared he had heard him say he not only worshiped
the Virgin Mary, but all good women who conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
good thoughts and had high and holy aspirations. Then
someone had asked him what worship was, and he said
it “was not an act of the body, like going to a church
and kneeling, but only that state of mind where the
worshiper thought of the person or being worshiped with
profound respect, good-will and love.”</p>

<p>The simple country people were very sure that any man
who held such heretical beliefs was a rascal or worse, and
being about like other people at the time, were honest in
the belief that a man who rejects the Trinity cannot have
much respect for the Ten Commandments. So they
were glad of an opportunity to assist in ridding the community
of a man who was endangering the religious
faith of the young. In short, the man was corrupting
the youth of Athens and must go.</p>

<p>On this particular occasion Bilkson was leader, for
when a man assumes leadership and calls in a loud voice
“Fall in everybody,” he is never without a following.</p>

<p>The persistent advertiser in trade is a self-appointed
leader, and if he talks big and keeps his promise passably
well, he can hold his followers for a time at least.</p>

<p>If you would go well-dressed, smiling, serene and
confident, to the homes of any of these mobbers, they
would acknowledge your superiority; and if you were
only firm and plausible, they would grant you any
favor and lend you any assistance you desired. You
are leader then&mdash;not Bilkson. But woe betide you if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
cold, naked, a-hungered, you fall famishing on their doorsteps,
and at the same time some Bilkson happens to
point the finger of suspicion in your direction. You
have no “inflooence.” “Inflooence” is king not only
with Straight, superintendents of schools, and other
politicians, but also in society and church. He who
subscribes the largest amount to the pastor’s salary has
the most to say in the management of the church, and
if he becomes displeased he threatens to “come out,”
(the “come outers” are numerous), and adds, “You
know that if I go I do not go alone.” Thus does he
shake his “inflooence” over us as a club, and we cringe,
explain, apologize, and the fear that the big subscriber
will tramp out with heavy tread, numerous following
and fierce black looks, disappears as we see the great
man placated by our abject attitude.</p>

<p>Fear of losing the favor of people of influence keeps
men respectful and decent when nothing else will.</p>

<p>“Inflooence” is first cousin to Mrs. Grundy. Inflooence
is king&mdash;Mrs. Grundy queen.</p>

<p>Note you how some men leave their quiet and virtuous
homes where Mrs. Grundy’s goggle eyes are on
every side, and go to New York where Mrs. Grundy is
not watching them. How intent they are on seeing the
“elephant,” and how they do buy green goods and gold
bricks! Great is “Inflooence”&mdash;great is Mrs. Grundy!</p>

<p>A grimy tramp with thick neck and knotty club possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
“inflooence.” His wishes in rural districts at least
are often respected.</p>

<p>Now you are a woman. You may be free from guilt
and you may not, but if you are purity itself&mdash;sorrowfully
do I say it!&mdash;in the year of Our Lord, 1891, innocence
is not a sufficient shield; and if you are weak,
weary and footsore, from the miles and miles you have
come down through years of injustice, and the crowd is
pressing you close with intent to stone you, it is a miracle
if from out the mob there steps the commanding
figure of a man, and raising his hand aloft to warn
them back, says in a voice not loud but which all can
hear,</p>

<p>“Let him who is without sin cast the first stone!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII_THE_FREEZER" id="CHAPTER_XXIII_THE_FREEZER">CHAPTER XXIII.<br /><span class="largefont">THE FREEZER.</span></a></h2>


<p>The freezer in No. 10 police-station is a very warm
place&mdash;an iron cage set up on a platform in a large stone
room; said cage being made of iron bars, set three
inches apart, with iron floor; the furniture consisting of
just two pieces, a wooden bench and an iron bucket.
This cage is open on all sides. “So as to give ventilation,”
I was told by the officer who helped me up the
steps. He remarked as the grated door swung to with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
a snap, “Oh, now me charmer, you will feel at home, for
you have been here many a time afore. Oh, we knows
you, we do. If yer wants anything jist tech the ’lectric
bell.”</p>

<p>This kind of cell, I am told by those who have tried
both, is much worse to be dreaded than a dungeon.
Open on all sides, the light is glaring; and any one coming
into the room, can walk around the cage, viewing
the unhappy prisoner from every side.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock Sunday morning when I was
locked up, and about every hour an officer came in and
looked at me as though I were a wild beast. Once two
men came together, and stood carrying on a joking conversation
between themselves. One seemed to be a
philosopher, for as they went out I heard him say, “It
beats the devil to what depths a woman falls when she
does go wrong!”</p>

<p>At six o’clock the captain came in, and he seemed
more gentlemanly and considerate than any of the
officers I had seen. He took off his cap, and leaning
against the bars of my cage, said,</p>

<p>“Now, you woman, I am awful sorry for you and am
going to help you out of this scrape. I know all about
you just as well or better than you know yourself. In
fact, your partner, the old man, has given the whole
thing away&mdash;made a clear confess, don’t you know&mdash;and
he will have to go down. Now if you will make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
clean breast of it all, we can let you off. We already
know all about it, but want you to confess just for a
formality so as to lay the case before the judge, who is
an awful tender-hearted man and does just as I tell him.
Now, lady, what do you say? Come, now, shall I unlock
that cage and take you in the office where we can write
it all out? Come, now, why don’t you speak, haven’t
you any tongue? Well, you are the queerest woman!
Can’t talk&mdash;eh? Oh! well, it’s no difference to me of
course. I just wanted to do you a favor, but you have
about as much gratitude as most of the rest of the soiled
doves. All right, you needn’t say a word if you don’t
want to. Hey, you there, Murphy, don’t let anybody
see this gal. Bread and water will do, too. She ain’t
any appetite. Do you hear?&mdash;I’m going now, miss. If
you have anything to say now is your time; but if you
prefer to have the cage locked for a week or so, why I
’spose you must have your own way. We’re allus willing
to oblige our guests, you know. Can’t even say
thank you, can you?” (Hesitates at the door&mdash;looks
back and goes).</p>

<p>Bang went the outside door and I was alone for the
night&mdash;my only company four electric lights, which
made a dazzling glare. I lay down on the bench and
tried to sleep. Then I tried the floor. At last I
propped the bench against the bars, and half-seated, half-reclining,
the long hours passed as a fitful nightmare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>I have since learned that when Martha Heath saw me
in the patrol-wagon she hastened straight to the station-house,
but they told her I was not there, and showed her
the blotter showing the name of “Mary Roe”&mdash;Bilkson
having explained that my right name was unknown, and
further by keeping a prisoner very close they are more
apt to confess.</p>

<p>Martha insisted on seeing Mary Roe, who they said
was asleep and must not be disturbed. “Call to-morrow,”
they said. Martha still insisted, until the
captain bawled out to the doorman, “Hey, you, have you
got a vacant cell for this crazy woman?” Martha was
not to be frightened by such a threat so she said,
“All right, put me in a cell! I dare you to! I’m no
better than Aspasia Hobbs, and you have locked her up.”
The captain took the persistent Martha by the arm, and
led her to the door and showed her down the steps.</p>

<p>The good girl saw she was powerless, and as my
mother knew nothing about the matter she concluded to
wait until Monday morning and then stir heaven and
earth if needs be to get me out.</p>

<p>Monday morning, bright and early, Mr. Bilkson and
Mr. Woodbur walked arm in arm down South Division
street, to the cottage of Mrs. Hobbs, and Grimes showed
them into the little parlor. Mrs. Hobbs entered, delighted
to think two such eminent gentlemen should call on her;
and in her joy she forgot the time of day, and believed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was only a social call, for on Delaware Avenue callers
were constant. What is the matter with South Division
street?</p>

<p>Both gentlemen shook hands with the widow. Then
they whispered together. Then Woodbur said,</p>

<p>“Mr. Bilkson, will you please oblige the lady and also
myself by assuming a standing position?”</p>

<p>Bilkson obeyed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bilkson, now will you further oblige us by opening
your mouth?”</p>

<p>Bilkson’s face opened in half, and revealed to the now
thoroughly astonished woman a very lacerated set of
gums and absence of front teeth.</p>

<p>“That will do, Mr. Bilkson. Now your eye.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bilkson removed the bandage from his left eye,
and revealed a symphony in black, blue and yellow,
shaded with green.</p>

<p>“That will do, Mr. Bilkson&mdash;be seated.”</p>

<p>Woodbur still remained standing in tragic attitude,
with his right hand thrust in the bosom of his buttoned
coat. Suddenly raising his voice he shouted,</p>

<p>“Madame, it was your daughter who done this&mdash;your
daughter! Yes, madame, your daughter! Ah, you
doubt it; but I have the proof, madame, the proof!” and
he drew forth a copy of the <cite>Morning Times</cite> on which the
ink was scarcely dry and read in a deep sepulchral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
voice the article which I have already mentioned,
“Beauty’s Blowout,” etc.</p>

<p>Among his other accomplishments Mr. Woodbur was
an elocutionist, and Grimes afterward told me that he read
the article so effectively and with such fierce looks
directed over the top of the paper at Mrs. Hobbs, that
at the last words the good lady fell in hysterics on the
sofa, screaming:</p>

<p>“Oh, my daughter, my adopted daughter! why did
you do this? Why did you do it? Disgraced us!
You have disgraced us! I, who before we bust, when we
lived on the avenue, furnished you a chiropodist, and an
elocootionist, and a manicure, and the best pew in the
Rev. Doctor Fourthly’s! I, who educated you, and cared
for you, and never let you go to the public but always
sent you to a private school, and taught you dancing,
French and music, and gave tiddle de winks and progressive
eucher parties in your honor! Oh, why, w-w-w-h-y&mdash;d-d-did
you do i-t-t-t!”</p>

<p>Dr. Bolus was hastily sent for and administered morphine
and whisky. When my mother had been quieted
(Woodbur and Bilkson had in the meantime departed),
the doctor called in Grimes and demanded the reason of
this row which had so unnerved Mrs. Hobbs.</p>

<p>“Some dam lie about ’Pasia that is in the paper,” said
Grimes. “Two devils with high hats was here&mdash;one had
no teeth&mdash;and they read the paper at Mrs. Hobbs’ head so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
she just throws up her hands and yells and yells and
cries and shouts and thanks God that ’Pasia ain’t her
own child. And then she cries agin and so she kep’ it
up ’till you come.”</p>

<p>“Why, why this is queer, very strange! Two&mdash;what
did you say they were that read the paper, Grimes?
Strange!&mdash;Say, you black cub” (calling to a colored boy
holding his horse at the door) “get up town, as quick as
you can and get me a <cite>Times</cite>. Don’t play marbles on the
way, or I’ll slice you up for a subject.”</p>

<p>The boy soon returned with the paper, and the doctor
quickly adjusted his glasses and read the article. He
dropped the paper from his hands and sat in amazement.</p>

<p>“It’s acute dementia, combined with melancholia! I
knew it all along&mdash;hereditary! Who were her parents,
Mrs. Hobbs? Ah, yes, you don’t know. That proves
it&mdash;hereditary! Takes to crime like a duck to water.
Why, she’s crazy, that’s all, Mrs. Hobbs, crazy as a bed
bug! Now take these powders as I told you, Mrs. Hobbs&mdash;but
then, we ought to get the girl out though.
What’s that! Great God! She killed Bilkson did you
say? Why didn’t you tell me five minutes ago that
Bilkson was here? Oh, I see; she <em>tried</em> to kill him.
That is different.”</p>

<p>“And it’s a pity she didn’t succeed!” broke in
Grimes, who was standing in the doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you shut up, you old fool!” shouted the doctor.
“How impertinent servants are getting now-a-days!
Never mind, Grimesy, you don’t know any better. I’ll
be here with my double carriage at one o’clock, and we
will all go up and get Aspasia out. Oh, I say, Grimes,
if the old lady has ’em again just put the powders in
the whisky and give her a tablespoonful every ten
minutes until she lets up&mdash;hear?”</p>

(<em>Spoken</em>) Now, Mr. Woodbur, you represent the prosecution&mdash;which

Did they do it? Not if the court house understands

anyone got a right to carry a package without being
jumped on by a fool glue-maker?&mdash;Well, that is all
right&mdash;let me say a word now and then&mdash;there ain’t
no proof she ever stole a cent’s worth of glue; and
what’s more, you hadn’t any business out there tryin’
to get up in her room at three o’clock in the morning
when you hadn’t any appointment with her&mdash;(<em>aside</em>&mdash;Eh!
Donahue, how’s that!!) No, sir; and you
too, Woodbur, you old stick-fast, what the devil are you
always tryin’ to get decent folks in trouble for?
Haven’t women got hard enough time to get along without
being dogged by a pot-bellied shyster, a cross between
a detective and an attorney, who sports a high
white hat with a black band, which means he is in
mourning for his lost virtue?&mdash;Shut up, will you.
Don’t talk back to me, Woodbur! I’m on to you with
both feet. You haven’t proved a thing against the gal
or against the man. The old fellow enticed the gal
off, into the woods did he? How do you know he did,
are you a mind reader? Well, I see no fault in him.
I’ll scourge him and let him go&mdash;that is, I’ll fine him
five dollars on general principles for disorderly conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and kick him out. Will you shut up, you dirty blackguard!
Confound you Woodbur, who is running this
court anyway, you or me? What do I care for Doctor
Bolus? To hell with Bolus! Where is he? I’ll give
him thirty days. The girl ain’t crazy. She ain’t crazy,
I tell you&mdash;she has got more sense than anyone in
the court room but me&mdash;(<em>aside</em>&mdash;Eh, Donahue?) Of
course she wouldn’t answer their questions. Neither
would I. Here you arrest a man and woman on a mere
groundless suspicion, or ’cause you got a spite against
them, and then the whole police department turns to and
tries to justify the arrest by blackening their characters.
When you once puts your claws on a man you turn the
county upside down and wrong side out to convict him&mdash;when
you know he ain’t guilty, but you just work to
make a reputation for yourself. I’m drunk, am I, Bilkson?
Here you clerk, Mr. Bilkson is fined five dollars
for contempt of court. What’s that? I have no right to
fine you? Oh, no, that’s so, I haven’t?&mdash;make it ten, Mr.
Clerk. No, sir, I won’t even fine the old man, but I’ll fine
you, Woodbur, if you give me any more of your jaw.
You Balaam’s ass&mdash;you make me weary! You say you
found ’em out there together. Well, you old reprobate,
hasn’t the gal reached the age of consent? (<em>Aside</em>&mdash;Eh&mdash;Donahue,
how’s that?) <em>Silence in the court!!</em>
Git out of here, Mary Roe alias Aspasia Hobbs. Bounce
you, John Doe, and never show up here again! You’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>

<p>Martha Heath took my arm as we walked down the
steps from the court-room, and The Man walked by my
side. I looked at him, and on the gentle face I saw not
the slightest look of trouble, unrest or nervous tension.
While my nerves were completely unstrung by the last
three days’ experience, he looked as refreshed as if he
had just come from the quiet and restful woods. He
was hatless&mdash;the same magnificent poise of the head&mdash;calm,
serene. He turned on me those wondering gentle
eyes as we stood on the walk for an instant. He did not
speak. I noted the firm chest, the strongly corded
neck, the massive head with its snow-white wavy hair,
face large-featured and bronzed by the kiss of the summer
sun, lean of flesh as though chiseled by manly abstinence,
plain, but all stamped with the seal of fearless
honesty, the lips parted showing the strong white teeth,
the voice came low but firm,</p>

that such a man could not hold the position, it must be explained
that in the city of Buffalo this office is an elective
one, and is held by the person able to control the caucus and
secure the votes; so very naturally the gentleman has an eye
on next year’s election, and when he appoints new teachers
he accepts those (provided of course they are competent) who
are best backed up by influential friends. It must be said,
however, that the present incumbent of the office alluded to
is a most worthy and competent man, and also that the
school-teachers of Buffalo outrank in fitness those of most
other cities; but these two facts do not in the least condone
the dangerous principle of having the office of Superintendent

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
